  abstract = {We report here an extension of the measurement of the all-particle cosmic-ray spectrum with IceTop to lower energy. The new measurement gives full coverage of the knee region of the spectrum and reduces the gap in energy between previous IceTop and direct measurements. With a new trigger that selects events in closely spaced detectors in the center of the array, the IceTop energy threshold is lowered by almost an order of magnitude below its previous threshold of 2 PeV. In this paper we explain how the new trigger is implemented, and we describe the new machine-learning method developed to deal with events with very few detectors hit. We compare the results with previous measurements by IceTop and others that overlap at higher energy and with HAWC and Tibet in the 100 TeV range.},

  abstract = {We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efficient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We find, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening ({$<$} c/a{$>$} {\textasciitilde} 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional `adiabatic-contraction' hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile {$\Lambda$}CDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's detailed assembly history.},

  abstract = {The standard {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H0, the {$\sigma$}8-S8 tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0 {$\sigma$} tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H0 and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H0 evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density {\textohm}m, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure ({$\sigma$}8 , f{$\sigma$}8). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H0-S8 tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper). From the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature data combined with \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} = (67.8 {\textpm} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, a matter density parameter {\textohm}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.308 {\textpm} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{s{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.968 {\textpm} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$} = 0.066 {\textpm} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.15 {\textpm} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} \emph{m{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} {\textohm}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} {\textbar} {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$><$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(\emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}) {$\propto$} \emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} potential. The addition of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w{$<$}i/{$>$} = -1.006 {\textpm} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

This method is immune to effects of galaxy-halo misalignments that can potentially limit 2-point galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of halo anisotropy. Using a simple model for the projected mass distributions of dark matter halos, we construct an ellipticity estimator that sums over all possible triangular configurations of the 3-point function. By applying our estimator to halos from N-body simulations, we find that systematic errors in the recovered ellipticity will be at the {$<$}5\% fractional level. We estimate that future imaging surveys like LSST will have sufficient statistics to detect halo ellipticities using 3-point lensing.},

Its purpose is to serve as a flexible, easy-to-install and easy-to-use interface for both weak lensing simulators and observers and can be applied to real and mock data to study the systematics affecting weak lensing mass reconstruction. At the core of CLMM are routines to model the weak lensing shear signal given the underlying mass distribution of galaxy clusters and a set of data operations to prepare the corresponding data vectors. The theoretical predictions rely on existing software, used as backends in the code, that have been thoroughly tested and cross-checked. Combined, theoretical predictions and data can be used to constrain the mass distribution of galaxy clusters as demonstrated in a suite of example Jupyter Notebooks shipped with the software and also available in the extensive online documentation.},

  abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG50 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, complemented by a catalog of tagged globular clusters, to investigate the properties and build up of two extended luminous components: the intra-cluster light (ICL) and the intra-cluster globular clusters (ICGC). We select the 39 most massive groups and clusters in the box, spanning the range of virial masses \$5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {$<$} {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{200\}/{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {$<$} 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$. We find good agreement between predictions from the simulations and current observational estimates of the fraction of mass in the ICL and its radial extension. The stellar mass of the ICL is only \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textbackslash}\%-20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the stellar mass in the central galaxy but encodes useful information on the assembly history of the group or cluster. About half the ICL in all our systems is brought in by galaxies in a narrow stellar mass range, \$M\_*=10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. However, the contribution of low-mass galaxies (\$M\_*{$<$}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) to the build-up of the ICL varies broadly from system to system, \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}\%-45{\textbackslash}\%\$, a feature that might be recovered from the observable properties of the ICL at \$z=0\$. At fixed virial mass, systems where the accretion of dwarf galaxies plays an important role have shallower metallicity profiles, less metal content and a lower stellar mass in the ICL than systems where the main contributors are more massive galaxies. We show that intra-cluster GCs are also good tracers of this history, representing a valuable alternative when diffuse light is not detectable.},

We find that a significant fraction of ICL stars (\$8{\textbackslash}\%\$-\$28{\textbackslash}\%\$) are born in-situ. This amounts to a total stellar mass comparable to the central galaxy itself. Contrary to simple expectations, only a sub-dominant fraction of these in-situ ICL stars are born in the central regions and later re-distributed to more energetic orbits during mergers. Instead, many in-situ ICL stars form directly hundreds of kiloparsecs away from the central galaxy, in clouds condensing out of the circum-cluster medium. The simulations predict a present-date diffuse star formation rate of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$/yr, with higher rates at higher redshifts. The diffuse star forming component of the ICL is filamentary in nature, extends for hundreds of kiloparsecs and traces the distribution of neutral gas in the cluster host halo. We discuss briefly how numerical details of the baryonic treatment in the simulation may play a role in this result and conclude that a sensitivity of \$1.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-19\} - 2.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-18\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ in H\$\_{\textbackslash}alpha\$ flux (beyond current observational capabilities) would be necessary to detect this diffuse star-forming component in galaxy clusters.},

  abstract = {The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) is a three-layered imaging survey aimed at addressing some of the most important outstanding questions in astronomy today, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy. The survey has been awarded 300 nights of observing time at the Subaru Telescope, and it started in 2014 March. This paper presents the first public data release of HSC-SSP. This release includes data taken in the first 1.7 yr of observations (61.5 nights), and each of the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep layers covers about 108, 26, and 4 square degrees down to depths of i {$\sim$} 26.4, {$\sim$}26.5, and {$\sim$}27.0 mag, respectively (5 {$\sigma$} for point sources). All the layers are observed in five broad bands (grizy), and the Deep and UltraDeep layers are observed in narrow bands as well. We achieve an impressive image quality of 0\{{\textasciicircum}''.\}6 in the i band in the Wide layer. We show that we achieve 1\%-2\% point spread function (PSF) photometry (root mean square) both internally and externally (against Pan-STARRS1), and {$\sim$}10 mas and 40 mas internal and external astrometric accuracy, respectively. Both the calibrated images and catalogs are made available to the community through dedicated user interfaces and database servers. In addition to the pipeline products, we also provide value-added products such as photometric redshifts and a collection of public spectroscopic redshifts. Detailed descriptions of all the data can be found online. The data release website is https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp.},

Our joint analysis is based on the combination of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) weak-lensing mass measurements, XXL X-ray gas mass measurements, and HSC and Sloan Digital Sky Survey multiband photometry. We carry out a Bayesian analysis of multivariate mass-scaling relations of gas mass, galaxy stellar mass, stellar mass of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), and soft-band X-ray luminosity, by taking into account the intrinsic covariance between cluster properties, selection effect, weak-lensing mass calibration, and observational error covariance matrix. The mass-dependent slope of the gas mass-total mass (M500) relation is found to be \$1.29\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.16\}\$, which is steeper than the self-similar prediction of unity, whereas the slope of the stellar mass-total mass relation is shallower than unity; \$0.85\_\{-0.09\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$. The BCG stellar mass weakly depends on cluster mass with a slope of \$0.49\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\$. The baryon, gas mass, and stellar mass fractions as a function of M500 agree with the results from numerical simulations and previous observations. We successfully constrain the full intrinsic covariance of the baryonic contents. The BCG stellar mass shows the larger intrinsic scatter at a given halo total mass, followed in order by stellar mass and gas mass. We find a significant positive intrinsic correlation coefficient between total (and satellite) stellar mass and BCG stellar mass and no evidence for intrinsic correlation between gas mass and stellar mass. All the baryonic components show no redshift evolution.},

  abstract = {We present Diffstar , a smooth parametric model for the in situ star formation history (SFH) of galaxies. The Diffstar model is distinct from traditional SFH models because it is parametrized directly in terms of basic features of galaxy formation physics. Diffstar includes ingredients for: the halo mass assembly history; the accretion of gas into the dark matter halo; the fraction of gas that is eventually transformed into stars, {$\epsilon$}ms; the time-scale over which this transformation occurs, {$\tau$}cons; and the possibility that some galaxies will experience a quenching event at time tq, and may subsequently experience rejuvenated star formation. We show that our model is sufficiently flexible to describe the average stellar mass histories of galaxies in both the IllustrisTNG (TNG) and UniverseMachine (UM) simulations with an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}0.1 dex across most of cosmic time. We use Diffstar to compare TNG to UM in common physical terms, finding that: (i) star formation in UM is less efficient and burstier relative to TNG; (ii) UM galaxies have longer gas consumption time-scales, relative to TNG; (iii) rejuvenated star formation is ubiquitous in UM, whereas quenched TNG galaxies rarely experience sustained rejuvenation; and (iv) in both simulations, the distributions of {$\epsilon$}ms, {$\tau$}cons, and tq share a common characteristic dependence upon halo mass, and present significant correlations with halo assembly history. We conclude with a discussion of how Diffstar can be used in future applications to fit the SEDs of individual observed galaxies, as well as in forward-modelling applications that populate cosmological simulations with synthetic galaxies.},

A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multi-component, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multi-wavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multi-wavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators and theorists.},

Remarkably, we find that the redshift, mass and {$\sigma$}8 dependence of the mean smallest-to-largest axis ratio of haloes is well described by the simple power-law relation = (0.54 +/- 0.02)(Mvir/M*)-0.050+/-0.003, where s is measured at 0.3Rvir, and the z and {$\sigma$}8 dependences are governed by the characteristic non-linear mass, M*=M*(z, {$\sigma$}8). We find that the scatter about the mean s is well described by a Gaussian with {$\sigma$}{\textasciitilde} 0.1, for all masses and redshifts. We compare our results to a variety of previous works on halo shapes and find that reported differences between studies are primarily explained by differences in their methodologies. We address the evolutionary aspects of individual halo shapes by following the shapes of the haloes through {\textasciitilde}100 snapshots in time. We determine the formation scalefactor ac as defined by Wechsler et al. and find that it can be related to the halo shape at z= 0 and its evolution over time.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the consistency between lensing and clustering based on measurements from Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey combined with galaxy--galaxy lensing from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC) Year 1, and Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS)-1000. We find good agreement between these lensing data sets. We model the observations using the Dark Emulator and fit the data at two fixed cosmologies: Planck (S8~= 0.83), and a Lensing cosmology (S8~= 0.76). For a joint analysis limited to large scales, we find that both cosmologies provide an acceptable fit to the data. Full utilization of the higher signal-to-noise small-scale measurements is hindered by uncertainty in the impact of baryon feedback and assembly bias, which we account for with a reasoned theoretical error budget. We incorporate a systematic inconsistency parameter for each redshift bin, A, that decouples the lensing and clustering. With a wide range of scales, we find different results for the consistency between the two cosmologies. Limiting the analysis to the bins for which the impact of the lens sample selection is expected to be minimal, for the Lensing cosmology, the measurements are consistent with A~=~1; A~= 0.91~{\textpm}~0.04 (A~= 0.97~{\textpm}~0.06) using DES+KiDS (HSC). For the Planck case, we find a discrepancy: A~= 0.79~{\textpm}~0.03 (A~= 0.84~{\textpm}~0.05) using DES+KiDS (HSC). We demonstrate that a kinematic Sunyaev--Zeldovich-based estimate for baryonic effects alleviates some of the discrepancy in the Planck cosmology. This analysis demonstrates the statistical power of small-scale measurements; however, caution is still warranted given modelling uncertainties and foreground sample selection effects.},

  abstract = {The accreted component of stellar halos is composed of the contributions of several satellites, falling onto their host with their different masses, at different times, on different orbits. This work uses a suite of idealised, collisionless N-body simulations of minor mergers and a particle tagging technique to understand how these different ingredients shape each contribution to the accreted halo, in both density and kinematics. I find that more massive satellites deposit their stars deeper into the gravitational potential of the host, with a clear segregation enforced by dynamical friction. Earlier accretion events contribute more to the inner regions of the halo; more concentrated subhaloes sink deeper through increased dynamical friction. The orbital circularity of the progenitor at infall is only important for low-mass satellites: dynamical friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor mergers erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host virial mass ratios \${\textbackslash}gtrsim1/20\$. The kinematics of the stars contributed by each satellite is also ordered with satellite mass: low-mass satellites contribute fast-moving populations, in both ordered rotation and radial velocity dispersion. In turn, contributions by massive satellites have lower velocity dispersion and lose their angular momentum to dynamical friction, resulting in a strong radial anisotropy.},

  abstract = {In a purely cold dark matter universe, the initial matter power spectrum and its subsequent gravitational growth contain no special mass- or time-scales, and so neither do the emergent population statistics of internal dark matter (DM) halo properties. Using 1.5 million halos from three IllustrisTNG realizations of a LambdaCDM universe, we show that galaxy formation physics drives non-monotonic features ("wiggles") into DM property statistics across six decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. We characterize these features by extracting the halo mass-dependent statistics of five DM halo properties -- velocity dispersion, NFW concentration, density- and velocity-space shapes, and formation time -- using kernel-localized linear regression (KLLR). Comparing precise estimates of normalizations, slopes, and covariances between realizations with and without galaxy formation, we find systematic deviations across all mass-scales, with maximum deviations of 25\% at the Milky-Way mass of 1e12 Msun. The mass-dependence of the wiggles is set by the interplay between different cooling and feedback mechanisms, and we discuss its observational implications. The property covariances depend strongly on halo mass and physics treatment, but the correlations are mostly robust. Using multivariate KLLR and interpretable machine learning, we show the halo concentration and velocity-space shape are principal contributors, at different mass, to the velocity dispersion variance. Statistics of mass accretion rate and DM surface pressure energy are provided in an appendix. We publicly release halo property catalogs and KLLR parameters for the TNG runs at twenty epochs up to z = 12.},

  abstract = {We search for signatures of cosmological shocks in gas pressure profiles of galaxy clusters using the cluster catalogs from three surveys: the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) SZ survey, and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data releases 4, 5, and 6, and using thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) maps from SPT and ACT. The combined cluster sample contains around \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$ clusters with mass and redshift ranges \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13.7\} {$<$} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200m\}/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{15.5\}\$ and \$0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 2\$, and the total sky coverage of the maps is \${\textbackslash}approx 15,000 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$. We find a clear pressure deficit at \$R/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200m\}{\textbackslash}approx 1.1\$ in SZ profiles around both ACT and SPT clusters, estimated at \$6{\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance, which is qualitatively consistent with a shock-induced thermal non-equilibrium between electrons and ions. The feature is not as clearly determined in profiles around DES clusters. We verify that measurements using SPT or ACT maps are consistent across all scales, including in the deficit feature. The SZ profiles of optically selected and SZ-selected clusters are also consistent for higher mass clusters. Those of less massive, optically selected clusters are suppressed on small scales by factors of 2-5 compared to predictions, and we discuss possible interpretations of this behavior. An oriented stacking of clusters -- where the orientation is inferred from the SZ image, the brightest cluster galaxy, or the surrounding large-scale structure measured using galaxy catalogs -- shows the normalization of the one-halo and two-halo terms vary with orientation. Finally, the location of the pressure deficit feature is statistically consistent with existing estimates of the splashback radius.},

Applying localized linear regression, we extract halo mass-conditioned normalizations, slopes, and intrinsic covariance for (i) Nsat, the number of stellar mass-thresholded satellite galaxies within radius R200c of the halo; (ii) M{$\star$},tot, the total stellar mass within that radius, and (iii) M{$\star$},BCG, the gravitationally bound stellar mass of the central galaxy within a 100 kpc radius. The parameters show differences across the simulations, in part from numerical resolution, but there is qualitative agreement for the Nsat - M{$\star$},BCG correlation. Marginalizing over Mhalo, we find the Nsat kernel, p(ln Nsat {\textbar} Mhalo,z) to be consistently skewed left in all three simulations, with skewness parameter {$\gamma$} = -0.91 {\textpm} 0.02, while the M{$\star$},tot kernel shape is closer to lognormal. The highest resolution simulations find {$\gamma$} {$\simeq$} -0.8 for the z = 0 shape of the M{$\star$},BCG kernel. We provide a Gaussian mixture fit to the low-redshift Nsat kernel as well as local linear regression parameters tabulated for Mhalo {$>$} 1013.5 M{$\odot$} in all simulations.},

  abstract = {We perform a consistent comparison of the mass and mass profiles of massive (M{$\star$} \&gt; 1011.4\,M{$\odot$}) central galaxies at z {$\sim$} 0.4 from deep Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations and from the Illustris, TNG100, and Ponos simulations. Weak lensing measurements from HSC enable measurements at fixed halo mass and provide constraints on the strength and impact of feedback at different halo mass scales. We compare the stellar mass function (SMF) and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) at various radii and show that the radius at which the comparison is performed is important. In general, Illustris and TNG100 display steeper values of {$\alpha$} where \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \} {\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$. These differences are more pronounced for Illustris than for TNG100 and in the inner rather than outer regions of galaxies. Differences in the inner regions may suggest that TNG100 is too efficient at quenching in situ star formation at Mvir {$\simeq$} 1013\,M{$\odot$} but not efficient enough at Mvir {$\simeq$} 1014\,M{$\odot$}. The outer stellar masses are in excellent agreement with our observations at Mvir {$\simeq$} 1013\,M{$\odot$}, but both Illustris and TNG100 display excess outer mass as Mvir {$\simeq$} 1014\,M{$\odot$} (by {$\sim$}0.25 and {$\sim$}0.12\,dex, respectively). We argue that reducing stellar growth at early times in \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9-10\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ galaxies would help to prevent excess ex-situ growth at this mass scale. The Ponos simulations do not implement AGN feedback and display an excess mass of {$\sim$}0.5\,dex at r \&lt; 30\,kpc compared to HSC which is indicative of overcooling and excess star formation in the central regions. The comparison of the inner profiles of Ponos and HSC suggests that the physical scale over which the central AGN limits star formation is r {$\lessequivlnt$} 20\,kpc. Joint comparisons between weak lensing and galaxy stellar profiles are a direct test of whether simulations build and deposit galaxy mass in the correct dark matter haloes and thereby provide powerful constraints on the physics of feedback and galaxy growth. Our galaxy and weak lensing profiles are publicly available to facilitate comparisons with other simulations.},

  abstract = {Perhaps the most basic question we can ask about cosmological correlations is how their strength changes as we smoothly vary kinematic parameters. The answer is encoded in differential equations that govern this evolution in kinematic space. In this Letter, we introduce a new perspective on these differential equations. We show that, in the simplified setting of conformally coupled scalars in a general FRW spacetime, the equations for arbitrary tree-level processes can be obtained from a small number of simple combinatorial rules. While this "kinematic flow" is defined purely in terms of boundary data, it reflects the physics of bulk time evolution. The unexpected regularity of the equations suggests the existence of an autonomously defined mathematical structure from which cosmological correlations, and the time evolution of the associated spacetime, emerge.},

  abstract = {Upcoming wide field surveys will have many overlapping epochs of the same region of sky. The conventional wisdom is that in order to reduce the errors sufficiently for systematics-limited measurements, like weak lensing, we must do simultaneous fitting of all the epochs. Using current algorithms this will require a significant amount of computing time and effort. In this paper, we revisit the potential of using coadds for shear measurements. We show on a set of image simulations that the multiplicative shear bias can be constrained below the 0.1\% level on coadds, which is sufficient for future lensing surveys. We see no significant differences between simultaneous fitting and coadded approaches for two independent shear codes: Metacalibration and BFD. One caveat of our approach is the assumption of a principled coadd, i.e. the PSF is mathematically well-defined for all the input images. This requires us to reject CCD images that do not fully cover the coadd region. We estimate that the number of epochs that must be rejected for a survey like LSST is on the order of 20\%, resulting in a small loss in depth of less than 0.1 magnitudes. We also put forward a cell-based coaddition scheme that meets the above requirements for unbiased weak lensing shear estimation in the context of LSST.},

  abstract = {We present a pedagogical review of the halo model, a flexible framework that can describe the distribution of matter and its tracers on non-linear scales for both conventional and exotic cosmological models. We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses. The halo properties are specified through a series of simulation-calibrated ingredients including the halo mass function, non-linear halo bias and a dark matter density profile that can additionally account for the impact of baryon feedback. By incorporating a model of the galaxy halo occupation distribution, the properties of central and satellite galaxies, their non-linear bias and intrinsic alignment can be predicted. Through analytical calculations of spherical collapse in exotic cosmologies, the halo model also provides predictions for non-linear clustering in beyond-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM models. The halo model has been widely used to model observations of a variety of large-scale structure probes, most notably as the primary technique to model the underlying non-linear matter power spectrum. By documenting these varied and often distinct use cases, we seek to further coherent halo model analyses of future multi-tracer observables. This review is accompanied by the release of pyhalomodel: https://github.com/alexander-mead/pyhalomodel , flexible software to conduct a wide range of halo-model calculations.},

  abstract = {We present a percent-level accurate model of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies around dark matter halos as a function of projected radius and halo mass. The model is developed and tested using synthetic galaxy catalogs generated with the UniverseMachine run on the Multi-Dark Planck 2 N-body simulations. The model decomposes the galaxies around a cluster into three kinematically distinct classes: orbiting, infalling, and interloping galaxies. We demonstrate that: 1) we can statistically distinguish between these three types of galaxies using only projected line-of-sight velocity information; 2) the halo edge radius inferred from the line-of-sight velocity dispersion is an excellent proxy for the three-dimensional halo edge radius; 3) we can accurately recover the full velocity dispersion profile for each of the three populations of galaxies. Importantly, the velocity dispersion profiles of the orbiting and infalling galaxies contain five independent parameters -- three distinct radial scales and two velocity dispersion amplitudes -- each of which is correlated with mass. Thus, the velocity dispersion profile of galaxy clusters has inherent redundancies that allow us to perform nontrivial systematics check from a single data set. We discuss several potential applications of our new model for detecting the edge radius and constraining cosmology and astrophysics using upcoming spectroscopic surveys.},

  abstract = {Galaxies are 3D objects, but we only observe their 2D projection. Extracting observational constraints on 3D galaxy shape is instrumental to aid our understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we use a supervised machine learning algorithm to probe the relation between the 3D galaxy shape and 2D summary statistics and hence attempt to understand how much information about the 3D shape of a galaxy can be inferred from its 2D image characteristics. Specifically, we use simulated data from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations, and use Random Forests to classify the 3D shape of galaxies. We find that while non-optimal, our algorithm is able to classify prolate vs. not-prolate galaxies to a certain degree; we are working on optimizing the features to improve the efficiency of our classifier. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, our algorithm provides a list of features that may be strong proxies for the 3D shape -- the distributions of which can be compared between simulations and observations, e.g., from HyperSupreme Cam survey data. Also, as a by-product of our use of both Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations, we find important differences between the two simulations: the production of lower stellar mass halos in IllustrisTNG, and comparable number of prolate vs. not-prolate galaxies in IllustrisTNG when compared to Illustris. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of using different classification criteria to classify galaxies as prolates vs. not, and find that they lead to rather different classifications -- a point of caution when considering various results in literature.},

Here we demonstrate how flexion measurements can be used to measure galaxy halo density profiles and large-scale structure on non-linear scales, via galaxy-galaxy lensing, dark matter mapping and cosmic flexion correlation functions. We describe the origin of gravitational flexion, and discuss its four components, two of which are first described here. We also introduce an efficient complex formalism for all orders of lensing distortion. We proceed to examine the flexion predictions for galaxy-galaxy lensing, examining isothermal sphere and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles and both circularly symmetric and elliptical cases. We show that in combination with shear we can precisely measure galaxy masses and NFW halo concentrations. We also show how flexion measurements can be used to reconstruct mass maps in two-dimensional projection on the sky, and in three dimensions in combination with redshift data. Finally, we examine the predictions for cosmic flexion, including convergence-flexion cross-correlations, and we find that the signal is an effective probe of structure on non-linear scales.},

We analyze deeper eROSITA observations of 1178 galaxy groups detected in eRASS1. We divide the sample into 271 subsamples and extract average thermodynamic properties, including electron density, temperature, and entropy at three characteristic radii along with the integrated temperature by jointly analyzing X-ray images and spectra following a Bayesian approach. We present the tightest constraints on the impact of AGN feedback through our average entropy and characteristic temperature measurements of the largest group sample used in X-ray studies, incorporating major systematics in our analysis. We find that entropy shows an increasing trend with temperature in the form of a power-law-like relation at the higher intra-group medium temperatures, while for the low mass groups, a slight flattening is observed on the average entropy. Overall, the observed entropy measurements agree well with the earlier measurements in the literature. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (MillenniumTNG, Magneticum, OWL simulations) after the applications of the selection function calibrated for our galaxy groups reveal that observed entropy profiles in the cores are below the predictions of simulations. At the mid-region, the entropy measurements agree well with the Magneticum simulations, whereas the predictions of MillenniumTNG and OWL simulations fall below observations. At the outskirts, the overall agreement between the observations and simulations improves, with Magneticum simulations reproducing the observations the best. Our measurements will pave the way for more realistic AGN feedback implementations in simulations.},

The characteristic mass increases with environmental density from about 1010.6 to (Kroupa initial mass function, H0 = 70) for {$\Sigma$} in the range 0.1-10Mpc-2. The galaxy population naturally divides into a red and blue sequence with the locus of the sequences in colour-mass and colour-concentration indices not varying strongly with environment. The fraction of galaxies on the red sequence is determined in bins of 0.2 in log{$\Sigma$} and bins). The red fraction fr generally increases continuously in both {$\Sigma$} and such that there is a unified relation: . Two simple functions are proposed which provide good fits to the data. These data are compared with analogous quantities in semi-analytical models based on the Millennium N-body simulation: the Bower et al. and Croton et al. models that incorporate active galactic nucleus feedback. Both models predict a strong dependence of the red fraction on stellar mass and environment that is qualitatively similar to the observations. However, a quantitative comparison shows that the Bower et al. model is a significantly better match; this appears to be due to the different treatment of feedback in central galaxies.},

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of this technique to achieve high precision mass calibration using redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey North Galactic Cap. By including cross-correlations between several richness bins in our analysis we significantly improve the statistical precision of our mass constraints. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is constrained to 7\% statistical precision. However, the error budget is systematics dominated, reaching an 18\% total error that is dominated by theoretical uncertainty in the bias-mass relation for dark matter halos. We perform a detailed treatment of the effects of assembly bias on our analysis, finding that the contribution of such effects to our parameter uncertainties is somewhat greater than that of measurement noise. We confirm the results from Miyatake et al. (2015) that the clustering amplitude of redMaPPer clusters depends on galaxy concentration, and provide additional evidence in support of this effect being due to some form of assembly bias. The results presented here demonstrate the power of cluster clustering for mass calibration and cosmology provided the current theoretical systematics can be ameliorated.},

We apply simulation based inference (SBI) using neural likelihood models to the problem. We show that in circumstances where the exact likelihood can be computed, the SBI constraints on cluster masses are in agreement with the exact likelihood, demonstrating that the SBI constraints are close to optimal. In scenarios where the exact likelihood cannot be feasibly computed, SBI still recovers unbiased estimates of individual cluster masses and combined constraints from multiple clusters. SBI will be a powerful tool for constraining the masses of galaxy clusters detected by future cosmic surveys. Code to run the analyses presented here will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, resulting in a distinct imprint in the CMB on arcminute scales. Measurement of this effect offers a promising way to constrain the masses of galaxy clusters, particularly those at high redshift. We use CMB maps from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) survey to measure the CMB lensing signal around galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey. The cluster catalogue used in this analysis contains 3697 members with mean redshift of \${\textbackslash}bar\{z\} = 0.45\$. We detect lensing of the CMB by the galaxy clusters at 8.1{$\sigma$} significance. Using the measured lensing signal, we constrain the amplitude of the relation between cluster mass and optical richness to roughly \$17{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{per{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash},cent\}\$ precision, finding good agreement with recent constraints obtained with galaxy lensing. The error budget is dominated by statistical noise but includes significant contributions from systematic biases due to the thermal SZ effect and cluster miscentring.},

  abstract = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk, \& White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak-lensing (WL) observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for {$\approx$}104 cluster-sized halos formed in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h-1 Gpc box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the WL masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is {$\approx$}20\% for massive clusters and can be as high as {$\approx$}30\% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that WL mass measurements can have a small, {$\approx$}5\%--10\%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that WL measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass--observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific WL mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {$<$} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown rockstar to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

Also presented are revised stellar mass - halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching time-scale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities.

For each bin, we model the data as a truncated NFW profile plus a two-halo term, taking into account uncertainties related to concentration and miscentring. From the retrieved estimates of the mean halo masses, we construct the A--M200 and the {$\lambda$}*--M200 relations. The relations extend over more than 1 order of magnitude in mass, down to \$M\_\{200\} {\textbackslash}sim 2{\textbackslash}, (5) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ at \$z\$ ~=~0.2\,(0.5), with small evolution in redshift.

  abstract = {Dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmological simulations of structure formation. These trees are frequently used as inputs to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone within which galaxy formation takes place. By necessity, these merger trees are constructed from a finite set of discrete 'snapshots' of the N-body simulation and so have a limited temporal resolution. To date, there has been little consideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties of galaxies formed within these trees. In particular, the question of how many snapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not be answered. Therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonic masses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions and star formation rates in the GALACTICUS model of galaxy formation as a function of the number of 'snapshot' times used to represent dark matter halo merger trees. When utilizing snapshots between z= 20 and 0, we find that at least 128 snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5 per cent for galaxy masses, while 64 snapshots give convergence only to within 10 per cent for high-mass haloes. This convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples of galaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when using very large numbers of snapshots. We find only weak dependence of the rate of convergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaced uniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansion factor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse work equally well in almost all cases. We provide input parameters to GALACTICUS which allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations and to be carried out for other galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the ``halo occupation distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P(N{\textbar}M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N{\textbar}M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of {$\xi$}g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

  abstract = {A forward modelling approach provides simple, fast and realistic simulations of galaxy surveys, without a complex underlying model. For this purpose, galaxy clustering needs to be simulated accurately, both for the usage of clustering as its own probe and to control systematics. We present a forward model to simulate galaxy surveys, where we extend the Ultra-Fast Image Generator to include galaxy clustering. We use the distribution functions of the galaxy properties, derived from a forward model adjusted to observations. This population model jointly describes the luminosity functions, sizes, ellipticities, SEDs and apparent magnitudes. To simulate the positions of galaxies, we then use a two-parameter relation between galaxies and halos with Subhalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). We simulate the halos and subhalos using the fast PINOCCHIO code, and a method to extract the surviving subhalos from the merger history. Our simulations contain a red and a blue galaxy population, for which we build a SHAM model based on star formation quenching. For central galaxies, mass quenching is controlled with the parameter M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{limit\}\}\$, with blue galaxies residing in smaller halos. For satellite galaxies, environmental quenching is implemented with the parameter t\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{quench\}\}\$, where blue galaxies occupy only recently merged subhalos. We build and test our model by comparing to imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1. To ensure completeness in our simulations, we consider the brightest galaxies with \$i{$<$}20\$. We find statistical agreement between our simulations and the data for two-point correlation functions on medium to large scales. Our model provides constraints on the two SHAM parameters M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{limit\}\}\$ and t\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{quench\}\}\$ and offers great prospects for the quick generation of galaxy mock catalogues, optimized to agree with observations.},

These methods minimize the ellipticity measurement noise, provide calculable shear uncertainty estimates, and allow removal of systematic contamination by PSF effects to arbitrary precision. Galaxy images and PSFs are expressed as ``Laguerre expansions,'' a two-dimensional generalization of the Edgeworth expansion, making the PSF correction and shape measurement relatively straightforward and computationally efficient.

  abstract = {We analyse the impact of galaxy--halo misalignment on the ability of weak lensing studies to constrain the shape of dark matter haloes, using a combination of the Millennium dark matter N-body simulation and different semi-analytic galaxy formation models, as well as simpler Monte Carlo tests. Since the distribution of galaxy--halo alignments is not known in detail, we test various alignment models, together with different methods of determining the halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass and shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked projected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers of galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo axis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such as those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity signal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure observationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis ratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models and between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty. It is na{\textasciidieresis}{\i}ve to assume that, simply because cold dark matter ( CDM) predicts aspherical haloes, the stacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust CDM prediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such elliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will be extremely difficult.},

  abstract = {We investigate the spins and shapes of over a million dark matter haloes identified at z = 0 in the Millennium simulation. Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the TREE halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' (SO) algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P({$\lambda$}), of the dimensionless spin parameter {$\lambda$}, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for TREE and SO haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of {$\lambda$}med = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass ({$\lambda$}med {\textasciitilde} 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape ({$\lambda$}med {\textasciitilde} 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of {\textasciitilde}2.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z {\textasciitilde} 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, {$\rho$}(e ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, {$\rho$}({$<$}1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with (r 1+2/r 1) {\textasciitilde} (M 1+2/M 1)2. A simple model where compact galaxies with masses {\textasciitilde}1011 M sun primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH - {$\sigma$} relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies.},

We exploit the overlap with Galaxy And Mass Assembly spectroscopy as calibration to determine photo-zs with the supervised machine learning neural network algorithm implemented in the ANNz2 software. The photo-zs have a mean error of {\textbar}{$\langle\delta$}z{$\rangle\vert\sim$}5 {\texttimes} 10-4 and low scatter (scaled mean absolute deviation of {$\sim$}0.018(1 + z)); they are both practically independent of the r-band magnitude and photo-z at 0.05 {$<$} zphot {$<$} 0.5. Combined with the 9-band photometry, these allow us to estimate robust absolute magnitudes and stellar masses for the full sample. As a demonstration of the usefulness of these data, we split the dataset into red and blue galaxies, used them as lenses, and measured the weak gravitational lensing signal around them for five stellar mass bins. We fit a halo model to these high-precision measurements to constrain the stellar-mass-halo-mass relations for blue and red galaxies. We find that for high stellar mass (M{$\star$} {$>$} 5 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$}), the red galaxies occupy dark matter halos that are much more massive than those occupied by blue galaxies with the same stellar mass.

First the theorem is applied to rotating elliptical galaxies whose constant-density surfaces are similar ellipsoids. A relationship is obtained between the observed rotations and the forms of generally triaxial galaxies. By applying the results of Robert (1962) to the evaluation of the components of the Chandrasekhar tensor which occurs in this relationship, it is found that the form of a galaxy that lacks global velocity anisotropy uniquely determines the ratio of its rotational and random kinetic energies independently of the radial density profile of that galaxy. A distribution of three-dimensional prolate spheroids is derived which accounts for the observed distribution of ellipticities reported by Sandage, Freeman, and Stokes (1970). This is then used to derive curves giving the expected frequency of occurrence of galaxies of given rotational velocities for each of a number of different apparent elongations on the sky. It is found that if elliptical galaxies are prolate, there should be little correlation between apparent ellipticity and rotation velocity.},

  abstract = {Galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) are a critical uncertainty for current and future weak lensing measurements. We describe a perturbative expansion of IA, analogous to the treatment of galaxy biasing. From an astrophysical perspective, this model includes the expected large-scale alignment mechanisms for galaxies that are pressure-supported (tidal alignment) and rotation-supported (tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between the two. Alternatively, this expansion can be viewed as an effective model capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include terms up to second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting IA contributions to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial amplitudes of the IA parameters, we find the quadratic alignment and linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections to the total intrinsic alignment signal at \$k{\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textbackslash},h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}\$, depending on the source redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant biases on inferred cosmological parameters in Stage IV photometric weak lensing surveys. We perform forecasts for an LSST-like survey, finding that use of the standard "NLA" model for intrinsic alignments cannot remove these large parameter biases, even when allowing for a more general redshift dependence. The model presented here will allow for more accurate and flexible IA treatment in weak lensing and combined probes analyses, and an implementation is made available as part of the public FAST-PT code. The model also provides a more advanced framework for understanding the underlying IA processes and their relationship to fundamental physics.},

We develop a formalism for treating this intrinsic alignment (IA) in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing and present an improved method for measuring IA contamination, which can arise when sources physically associated with the lens are placed behind the lens due to photometric redshift scatter. We apply the technique to recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of Luminous Red Galaxy lenses and typical ( {$\sim$} L*) source galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the SDSS imaging data. Compared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fully self-consistent in its treatment of the IA and lensing signals, solving for the two simultaneously. We find an IA signal consistent with zero, placing tight constraints on both the magnitude of the IA effect and its potential contamination to the lensing signal. While these constraints depend on source selection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurement that uses photometric redshifts. We obtain a model-independent upper-limit of roughly 10\% IA contamination for projected separations of rp {$\approx$} 0.1--10h-1Mpc. With more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about the physics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1--2\%. These limits are well below the statistical error of the current lensing measurements. Our results suggest that IA will not present intractable challenges to the next generation of galaxy-galaxy lensing experiments, and the methods presented here should continue to aid in our understanding of alignment processes and in the removal of IA from the lensing signal.},

  abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing has become a powerful probe of large-scale structure and cosmological parameters. Precision weak lensing measurements require an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities, which can in turn inform models of galaxy formation. It is hypothesized that elliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that this alignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities on cosmological scales (in the absence of lensing). We use recent large-scale structure measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to test this picture with several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxy overdensity, w\_\{g+\}; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions; (3) the correlation functions of curl-free, E, and divergence-free, B, modes (the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory); (4) the alignment correlation function, w\_g(r\_p,theta), a recently developed statistic that generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the angle between the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity. We show that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignment model and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity. In addition, we show that at linear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence of w\_g(r\_p,theta) is simply w\_\{g+\}*cos(2*theta) and that this dependence is consistent with recent measurements. We also study how stochastic nonlinear contributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics. We find that a significant fraction of the observed LRG ellipticity can be explained by alignment with the tidal field on scales {$>$}{\textasciitilde}10 h{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc. These considerations are relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.},

Contributions from density weighting are found to be particularly important and lead to bias dependence of the IA amplitude, even on large scales. This effect may be responsible for much of the luminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase in IA amplitude for more highly biased galaxies reflects their locations in regions with large tidal fields. We also consider the impact of smoothing the tidal field on halo scales. We compare the performance of this consistent nonlinear model in describing the observed alignment of luminous red galaxies with the linear model as well as the frequently used "nonlinear alignment model," finding a significant improvement on small and intermediate scales. We also show that the cross-correlation between density and IA (the "GI" term) can be effectively separated into source alignment and source clustering, and we accurately model the observed alignment down to the one-halo regime using the tidal field from the fully nonlinear halo-matter cross correlation. Inside the one-halo regime, the average alignment of galaxies with density tracers no longer follows the tidal alignment prediction, likely reflecting nonlinear processes that must be considered when modeling IA on these scales. Finally, we discuss tidal alignment in the context of cosmic shear measurements.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature from 2500 deg2 of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of {$\xi$} = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95\%) of the {$\xi$} {$>$} 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z {\textasciitilde} 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c({$\rho$}crit) {$\sim$} 3.5{\texttimes} 1014 M\_{$\odot$} h70-1, the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z {$>$} 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

We use optical and infrared data from the Dark Energy Camera and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and {\textbackslash}spitzer {\textbackslash} satellites, to confirm 544 of these candidates as clusters with \${\textbackslash}sim94{\textbackslash}\%\$ purity. The sample has an approximately redshift-independent mass threshold at redshift \$z{$>$}0.25\$ and spans \$1.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {$<$} M\_\{500c\} {$<$} 9.1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot/h\_\{70\}\$ {\textbackslash} and \$0.031\$. We use external radio data from the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) to estimate contamination to the SZ signal from synchrotron sources. The contamination reduces the recovered \${\textbackslash}xi\$ by a median value of 0.032, or \${\textbackslash}sim0.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the \${\textbackslash}xi=4\$ threshold value, and \${\textbackslash}sim7{\textbackslash}\%\$ of candidates have a predicted contamination greater than \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}xi = 1\$. With the exception of a small number of systems \$({$<$}1{\textbackslash}\%)\$, an analysis of clusters detected in single-frequency 95 and 150 GHz data shows no significant contamination of the SZ signal by emission from dusty or synchrotron sources. This cluster sample will be a key component in upcoming astrophysical and cosmological analyses of clusters. The SPTpol millimeter-wave maps and associated data products used to produce this sample are available at https://pole.uchicago.edu/public/data/sptpol\_500d\_clusters/index.html, and the NASA LAMBDA website.

  abstract = {We describe the observations and resultant galaxy cluster catalog from the 2770 deg2 SPTpol Extended Cluster Survey (SPT-ECS). Clusters are identified via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and confirmed with a combination of archival and targeted follow-up data, making particular use of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). With incomplete follow-up we have confirmed as clusters 244 of 266 candidates at a detection significance {$\xi$} {$\geq$} 5 and an additional 204 systems at 4 {$<$} {$\xi$} {$<$} 5. The confirmed sample has a median mass of M\_500c{$\sim$} 4.4{\texttimes}1014 M\_\{{$\odot$}\} h70-1 and a median redshift of z = 0.49, and we have identified 44 strong gravitational lenses in the sample thus far. Radio data are used to characterize contamination to the SZ signal; the median contamination for confirmed clusters is predicted to be {$\sim$}1\% of the SZ signal at the {$\xi$} {$>$} 4 threshold, and {$<$}4\% of clusters have a predicted contamination {$>$}10\% of their measured SZ flux. We associate SZ-selected clusters, from both SPT-ECS and the SPT-SZ survey, with clusters from the DES redMaPPer sample, and we find an offset distribution between the SZ center and central galaxy in general agreement with previous work, though with a larger fraction of clusters with significant offsets. Adopting a fixed Planck-like cosmology, we measure the optical richness-SZ mass ({$\lambda$}-M) relation and find it to be 28\% shallower than that from a weak-lensing analysis of the DES data - a difference significant at the 4{$\sigma$} level - with the relations intersecting at {$\lambda$} = 60. The SPT-ECS cluster sample will be particularly useful for studying the evolution of massive clusters and, in combination with DES lensing observations and the SPT-SZ cluster sample, will be an important component of future cosmological analyses.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, and the abundance of massive halos each probe the large-scale structure of the Universe in complementary ways. We present cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of the three probes, building on the latest analyses of the lensing-informed abundance of clusters identified by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and of the auto- and cross-correlation of galaxy position and weak lensing measurements (3{\texttimes}2pt) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We consider the cosmological correlation between the different tracers and we account for the systematic uncertainties that are shared between the large-scale lensing correlation functions and the small-scale lensing-based cluster mass calibration. Marginalized over the remaining {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) parameters (including the sum of neutrino masses) and 52 astrophysical modeling parameters, we measure {\textohm}m=0.300{\textpm}0.017 and {$\sigma$}8=0.797{\textpm}0.026. Compared to constraints from Planck primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, our constraints are only 15\% wider with a probability to exceed of 0.22 (1.2{$\sigma$}) for the two-parameter difference. We further obtain S8{$\equiv\sigma$}8({\textohm}m/0.3)0.5=0.796{\textpm}0.013 which is lower than the Planck measurement at the 1.6{$\sigma$} level. The combined SPT cluster, DES 3{\texttimes}2pt, and Planck datasets mildly prefer a nonzero positive neutrino mass, with a 95\% upper limit {$\sum$}m{$\nu<$}0.25 eV on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming a wCDM model, we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w=-1.15-0.17+0.23 and when combining with Planck primary CMB anisotropies, we recover w=-1.20-0.09+0.15, a 1.7{$\sigma$} difference with a cosmological constant. The precision of our results highlights the benefits of multiwavelength multiprobe cosmology and our analysis paves the way for upcoming joint analyses of next-generation datasets.},

For the DES Year 3 data, we report a systematic uncertainty in weak-lensing mass calibration that increases from 1{\textbackslash}\% at \$z=0.25\$ to 10{\textbackslash}\% at \$z=0.95\$, to which we add 2{\textbackslash}\% in quadrature to account for uncertainties in the impact of baryonic effects. We implement an analysis pipeline that joins the cluster abundance likelihood with a multi-observable likelihood for the SZ, optical richness, and weak-lensing measurements for each individual cluster. We validate that our analysis pipeline can recover unbiased cosmological constraints by analyzing mocks that closely resemble the cluster sample extracted from the SPT-SZ, SPTpol{\textasciitilde}ECS, and SPTpol{\textasciitilde}500d surveys and the DES Year{\textasciitilde}3 and HST-39 weak-lensing datasets.

We propose a model that learns a shared covariance function on input-dependent features and a ``free-form'' covariance matrix over tasks. This al- lows for good flexibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assump- tion of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task trans- fer occurs. We evaluate the benefits of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task. Additionally, we make use of GP approximations and properties of our model in order to provide scalability to large data sets.},

They are: the standard CDM (SCDM) and a tilted ( n = 0.85) CDM (TCDM) model, a cold + hot DM (CHDM) model with {\textohm} {$\nu$} = 0.25 , two low-density flat CDM ({$\Lambda$}CDM) models with {\textohm} 0 = 0.3 and 0.5 , two open CDM (OCDM) models with {\textohm} 0 = 0.4 and 0.6 . The Hubble constant is chosen so that t 0 ⋍ 13 Gyrs in all the models, while {\textohm} b = 0.02 h 2 is assumed for the baryon fraction. Clusters identified in the simulations are observed in projection so as to reproduce the main observational biases of the real data set. Clusters in the simulations are analysed by applying the same algorithm for interlopers removal and velocity dispersion estimate as for the reference observational sample. We find that {$\sigma\upsilon$} for individual model clusters can be largely affected by observational biases, especially for {$\sigma\upsilon$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 600 km s -1. The resulting effect of N({$>$} {$\sigma\upsilon$}) is rather model dependent: models in which clusters had less time to virialize show larger discrepancies between intrinsic (3D) and projected distribution of velocity dispersions. From the comparison with real clusters we find that both SCDM and TCDM largely overproduce clusters. We verified for TCDM that agreement with the observational N({$>$} {$\sigma\upsilon$}) requires {$\sigma$} 8 ⋍ 0.5 . As for the CHDM model, it marginally overproduces clusters and requires a somewhat larger {$\sigma$}8 value than a purely CDM model in order to produce the same cluster abundance. The {$\Lambda$}CDM model with {\textohm} 0 = 0.3 agrees with data, while the open model with {\textohm} 0 = 0.4 and 0.6 underproduces and marginally overproduces clusters, respectively.},

  abstract = {Studying the impact of systematic effects, optimizing survey strategies, assessing tensions between different probes and exploring synergies of different data sets require a large number of simulated likelihood analyses, each of which cost thousands of CPU hours. In this paper, we present a method to accelerate cosmological inference using emulators based on Gaussian process regression and neural networks. We iteratively acquire training samples in regions of high posterior probability which enables accurate emulation of data vectors even in high dimensional parameter spaces. We showcase the performance of our emulator with a simulated 3{\texttimes}2 point analysis of LSST-Y1 with realistic theoretical and systematics modelling. We show that our emulator leads to high-fidelity posterior contours, with an order of magnitude speed-up. Most importantly, the trained emulator can be re-used for extremely fast impact and optimization studies. We demonstrate this feature by studying baryonic physics effects in LSST-Y1 3{\texttimes}2 point analyses where each one of our MCMC runs takes approximately 5 min. This technique enables future cosmological analyses to map out the science return as a function of analysis choices and survey strategy.},

In this second paper in a series, we employ bulge+disc decompositions of realistic dust-free galaxy images from the Illustris simulation in a consistent comparison with galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Examining the size-luminosity relations of each sample, we find that galaxies in Illustris are roughly twice as large and 0.7 mag brighter on average than galaxies in the SDSS. The trend of increasing slope and decreasing normalization of size-luminosity as a function of bulge fraction is qualitatively similar to observations. However, the size-luminosity relations of Illustris galaxies are quantitatively distinguished by higher normalizations and smaller slopes than for real galaxies. We show that this result is linked to a significant deficit of bulge-dominated galaxies in Illustris relative to the SDSS at stellar masses log M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}/M\_\{{$\odot$}\}{$\lessequivlnt$} 11. We investigate this deficit by comparing bulge fraction estimates derived from photometry and internal kinematics. We show that photometric bulge fractions are systematically lower than the kinematic fractions at low masses, but with increasingly good agreement as the stellar mass increases.},

We also propose a new halo mass estimator, the cen+N mass: the sum of the stellar mass of the central and the N most massive satellites. We show that, when real space positions are perfectly known, the cen+N mass has scatter competitive with that of richness-based estimators. However, in redshift space, the cen+N mass suffers less from projection effects in the UniverseMachine model. The cen+N mass is therefore a viable low scatter halo mass estimator, and should be considered an important tool to constrain cosmology with upcoming spectroscopic data from DESI. We analyze the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass and show that the total stellar mass in a halo is uncorrelated with secondary halo properties, but that the central stellar mass is a function of both halo mass and halo age. This is because central galaxies in older halos have had more time to grow via accretion. If the UniverseMachine model is correct, accurate galaxy-halo modeling of mass selected samples therefore needs to consider halo age in addition to mass.},

Although there is a developing understanding of the mechanisms by which the ICL is formed, no strong consensus has yet been reached on which objects the stars of the ICL are primarily sourced from. We investigate the assembly of the ICL starting approximately 10 Gyr before \$z=0\$ in 11 galaxy clusters (halo masses between \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 7{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}approx 0\$) in the HORIZON-AGN simulation. By tracking the stars of galaxies that fall into these clusters past cluster infall, we are able to link almost all of the \$z{\textbackslash}approx 0\$ ICL back to progenitor objects. Satellite stripping, mergers, and pre-processing are all found to make significant contributions to the ICL, but any contribution from in situ star formation directly into the ICL appears negligible. Even after compensating for resolution effects, we find that approximately 90 per cent of the stacked ICL of the 11 clusters that is not pre-processed should come from galaxies infalling with stellar masses above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, with roughly half coming from infalling galaxies with stellar masses within half a dex of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. The fact that the ICL appears largely sourced from such massive objects suggests that the ICL assembly of any individual cluster may be principally stochastic.},

  abstract = {Context. The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Poentgen-Gamma (SPG) observatory combines a large field of view and a large collecting area in the energy range between {\textasciitilde}0.2 and {\textasciitilde}8.0 keV. This gives the telescope the capability to perform uniform scanning observations of large sky areas. Aims: SRG/eROSITA performed scanning observations of the {\textasciitilde}140 square degree eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey field (the eFEDS field) as part of its performance verification phase ahead of the planned four year of all-sky scanning operations. The observing time of eFEDS was chosen to slightly exceed the depth expected in an equatorial field after the completion of the all-sky survey. While verifying the capability of eROSITA to perform large-area uniform surveys and saving as a test and training dataset to establish calibration and data analysis procedures, the eFEDS survey also constitutes the largest contiguous soft X-ray survey at this depth to date, supporting a range of early eROSITA survey science investigations. Here we (i) present a catalogue of detected X-ray sources in the eFEDS field providing information about source positions and extent, as well as fluxes in multiple energy bands, and (ii) document the suite of tools and procedures developed for eROSITA data processing and analysis, which were validated and optimised by the eFEDS work. Methods: The data were fed through a standard data processing pipeline, which appltes X-ray event calibration and provides a set of standard calibrated data products. A mutiti-stage source detection procedure, building in part on experience from XMM-Newton, was optimised and calibrated by performing realistic simulations of the eROSITA eFEDS observations. Source fluxes were computed in multiple standard energy bands by forced point source fitting and aperture photometry. We cross-matched the eROSITA eFEDS source catalogue with previous XMM-ATLAS observations, which confirmed the excellentt agreement of the eROSITA and XMM-ATLAS source fluxes. Astrometric corrections were performed by cross-matching the eROSITA source positions with an optical reference catalogue of quasars. Results: We present a primary catalogue of 27 910 X-ray sources (542 of which are significantly spatially extended) detected in the 0.2-2.3 keV energy range with detection likelihoods {$\geq$}6, corresponding to a (point source) flux limit of 6.5 {\texttimes} 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 0.5-2.0 keV energy band (80\% completeness). A supplementary catalogue contains 4774 low-significance source candidates with detection likelihoods between 5 and 6. In addition, a hard-band sample of 246 sources detected in the energy range 22.3-5.0 keV above a detection likelihood of 10 is provided. In an appendix, we finally describe the dedicated data analysis software package, the eROSITA calibration database, and the standard calibrated data products.

  abstract = {eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) is the primary instrument on-board the Russian/German "Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma" (SRG) mission. It will perform the first all-sky imaging X-ray survey in the medium X-ray energy band. eROSITA is currently awaiting its launch from Baikonur in early 2019 into an L2 halo orbit. Preparations for eROSITA ground operations have been under way in parallel with the hardware development of the eROSITA telescope, comprising the areas mission planning, telescope operation and data reception, the operation of a data processing pipeline, and the creation of tools for data access and interactive data analysis. eROSITA mission: After a brief calibration and performance verification phase eROSITA will perform a four-year all-sky survey fully covering the sky eight times, which will be followed by several years of dedicated observations of interesting objects. Two ground antennas in Russia (near Moscow and in Siberia) will be available to provide several hours of daily ground contact for commanding and for data reception. eROSITA data rights will be equally divided between the Russian and German partners. Operation and data centers will exist at Max-Planck-Institut f{\"u}r extraterrestrische Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany and at the Russian Space Research Institute (IKI) in Moscow. Interfaces and procedures for mission planning, telescope operation and data exchange are closely coordinated between both sites. Mission planning and operation: Based on orbit simulations provided by the Russian side, a software environment for optimizing the desired sky coverage and observing efficiency while fulfilling visibility and solar constraints was set up. Agreed upon observing timelines will be converted to eROSITA and SRG command sequences fed to the Russian ground station for up-linking. MPE personnel will be on site either in Moscow or at MPE in Garching during each ground contact to conduct ondemand commanding and to assess instrument health and data quality. Data analysis pipeline and interactive data analysis: The eROSITA data processing pipeline consists of modules for data ingestion, event calibration, exposure calculation, source detection, and the creation of high-level source specific data products. It will be operated at MPE on a daily basis after each ground contact. A subset of the software tasks comprising the data analysis pipeline also functions as interactive data analysis tools. These can be grouped into tasks for X-ray event calibration, selection and binning, exposure, background and sensitivity map creation and for source detection. Data products are provided in a standards compliant FITS format for use with well-known high-level X-ray data analysis tools. A Web based graphical source catalog and data products viewer will allow easy data browsing. Since mid-2014 the interactive eROSITA data analysis package is available to the eROSITA user community, permitting the analysis of simulated eROSITA datasets, created by a sophisticated X-ray modeling and simulation tool.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies can be used as powerful probes to study astrophysical processes on large scales, test theories of the growth of structure, and constrain cosmological models. The driving science goal of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey is to assemble a large sample of X-ray clusters with a well-defined selection function to determine the evolution of the mass function and, hence, the cosmological parameters. We present here a catalog of 12 247 optically confirmed galaxy groups and clusters detected in the 0.2-2.3 keV as extended X-ray sources in a 13 116 deg2 region in the western Galactic half of the sky, which eROSITA surveyed in its first six months of operation. The clusters in the sample span the redshift range 0.003 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.32. The majority (68\%) of these clusters, 8361 sources, represent new discoveries without known counterparts in the literature. The mass range of the sample covers three orders of magnitude from 5 {\texttimes} 1012 Msun to 2 {\texttimes} 1015Msun. We construct a sample for cosmology with a higher purity level ({\textasciitilde}95\%) than the primary sample, comprising 5259 securely detected and confirmed clusters in the 12791 deg2 common footprint of eRASS1 and the DESI Legacy Survey DR10. We characterize the X-ray properties of each cluster, including their flux, luminosity and temperature, the total mass, gas mass, gas mass fraction, and mass proxy YX. These are determined within two apertures, 300 kpc, and the overdensity radius R500, and are calculated by applying a forward modeling approach with a rigorous X-ray background treatment, K-factor, and the Galactic absorption corrections. Population studies utilizing log N-log S, the number of clusters detected above a given flux limit, and the luminosity function show overall agreement with the previous X-ray surveys after accounting for the survey completeness and purity through the selection function. The first eROSITA All-Sky Survey provides an unprecedented sample of galaxy groups and clusters selected in the X-ray band. The eRASS1 cluster catalog demonstrates the excellent performance of eROSITA for extended source detection, consistent with the pre-launch expectations for the final all-sky survey, eRASS:8.

  abstract = {We discuss how current and future data on the clustering and number density of z{\textasciitilde}3 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) can be used to constrain their relationship to dark matter haloes. We explore a three-parameter model in which the number of LBGs per dark halo scales like a power law in the halo mass: N(M)=(M/M1)S for M{$>$}Mmin. Here, Mmin is the minimum mass halo that can host an LBG, M1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloes host more than one observed LBG, and S determines the strength of the mass-dependence. We show how these three parameters are constrained by three observable properties of LBGs: the number density, the large-scale bias and the fraction of objects in close pairs. Given these three quantities, the three unknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a full exploration of parameter space. As an example, we assume a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and consider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopically confirmed LBGs. We find that the favoured range for our model parameters is Mmin{\textasciitilde}=(0.4-8){\texttimes}1010h- 1Msolar, M1{\textasciitilde}=(6-10){\texttimes}1012h- 1Msolar, and 0.9{$<$}{\textasciitilde}S{$<$}{\textasciitilde}1.1. The preferred region in Mmin expands by an order of magnitude, and slightly shallower slopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bg is permitted to span all recent observational estimates. We also discuss how the observed clustering of LBGs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation, although because of current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach any strong conclusions. Our methods and results can be used to constrain more realistic models that aim to derive the occupation function N(M) from first principles, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect the observed properties of LBGs.},

  abstract = {If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way system should have accreted {\textasciitilde}100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past {\textasciitilde}12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semianalytic plus N-body approach that distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our accreted stellar halos have density profiles that typically drop off with radius faster than the dark matter and follow power laws at r{$>$}{\textasciitilde}30 kpc with {$\rho$}{\textasciitilde}r-{$\alpha$}, {$\alpha$}{\textasciitilde}=3-4. They are well fit by Hernquist profiles over the full radial range. We find that stellar halos are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass ({\textasciitilde}80\%) coming from the {\textasciitilde}15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase-space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

  abstract = {We present a novel method of robust probabilistic cosmic web particle classification in three dimensions using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Training data were generated using a simplified {$\Lambda$}CDM toy model with pre-determined algorithms for generating haloes, filaments, and voids. While this framework is not constrained by physical modelling, it can be generated substantially more quickly than an N-body simulation without loss in classification accuracy. For each particle in this data set, measurements were taken of the local density field magnitude and directionality. These measurements were used to train a random forest algorithm, which was used to assign class probabilities to each particle in a {$\Lambda$}CDM, dark matter-only N-body simulation with 2563 particles, as well as on another toy model data set. By comparing the trends in the ROC curves and other statistical metrics of the classes assigned to particles in each data set using different feature sets, we demonstrate that the combination of measurements of the local density field magnitude and directionality enables accurate and consistent classification of halo, filament, and void particles in varied environments. We also show that this combination of training features ensures that the construction of our toy model does not affect classification. The use of a fully supervised algorithm allows greater control over the information deemed important for classification, preventing issues arising from arbitrary hyperparameters and mode collapse in deep learning models. Due to the speed of training data generation, our method is highly scalable, making it particularly suited for classifying large data sets, including observed data.},

MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 {\AA} at R {\textasciitilde} 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 ({\AA}-1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 109 M {$\odot$} using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

These were identified in the SDSS/DR8 photometric data by the redMaPPer algorithm and split into high- and low-concentration subsamples based on the projected positions of cluster members. We use simplified versions of these procedures to build cluster samples of similar size from the simulation data. These match the observed samples quite well and show similar assembly bias and splashback signals. Previous theoretical work has found the logarithmic slope of halo density profiles to have a well-defined minimum whose depth decreases and whose radius increases with halo concentration. Projected profiles for the observed and simulated cluster samples show trends with concentration which are opposite to these predictions. In addition, for high-concentration clusters the minimum slope occurs at significantly smaller radius than predicted. We show that these discrepancies all reflect confusion between splashback features and features imposed on the profiles by the cluster identification and concentration estimation procedures. The strong apparent assembly bias is not reflected in the three-dimensional distribution of matter around clusters. Rather it is a consequence of the preferential contamination of low-concentration clusters by foreground or background groups.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing probe the connection between galaxies and their dark matter haloes in complementary ways. Since the clustering of dark matter haloes depends on cosmology, the halo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of galaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different cosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. Galaxy-galaxy lensing, which yields direct constraints on the actual mass-to-light ratios, can therefore be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to constrain cosmological parameters. In this paper, we establish the link between galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), {$\Phi$}(L{\textbar}M)dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L +/- dL/2 that reside in a halo of mass M. We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies. The resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. For a cosmology that agrees with constraints from the cosmic microwave background, i.e. ({\textohm}m,{$\sigma$}8) = (0.238,0.734), the model accurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For a comparison cosmology with ({\textohm}m,{$\sigma$}8) = (0.3,0.9), however, we can accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the galaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too high, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal. We conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing is a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to yield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly probes the mass distribution on relatively small (non-linear) scales, it is complementary to constraints obtained from the galaxy power spectrum, which mainly probes the large-scale (linear) matter distribution.},

  abstract = {The evolution of galaxy cluster counts is a powerful probe of several fundamental cosmological parameters. A number of recent studies using this probe have claimed tension with the cosmology preferred by the analysis of the Planck primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, in the sense that there are fewer clusters observed than predicted based on the primary CMB cosmology. One possible resolution to this problem is systematic errors in the absolute halo mass calibration in cluster studies, which is required to convert the standard theoretical prediction (the halo mass function) into counts as a function of the observable (e.g. X-ray luminosity, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux, and optical richness). Here we propose an alternative strategy, which is to directly compare predicted and observed cluster counts as a function of the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies. We argue that the velocity dispersion of groups/clusters can be theoretically predicted as robustly as mass but, unlike mass, it can also be directly observed, thus circumventing the main systematic bias in traditional cluster counts studies. With the aid of the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the potential of the velocity dispersion counts for discriminating even similar {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter models. These predictions can be compared with the results from existing redshift surveys such as the highly complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, and upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as the Wide Area Vista Extragalactic Survey and the Dark Energy Survey Instrument.},

  abstract = {The intracluster light (ICL) is an important tracer of a galaxy cluster's history and past interactions. However, only small samples have been studied to date due to its very low surface brightness and the heavy manual involvement required for the majority of measurement algorithms. Upcoming large imaging surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are expected to vastly expand available samples of deep cluster images. However, to process this increased amount of data, we need faster, fully automated methods to streamline the measurement process. This paper presents a machine learning model designed to automatically measure the ICL fraction in large samples of images, with no manual preprocessing required. We train the fully supervised model on a training data set of 50,000 images with injected artificial ICL profiles. We then transfer its learning onto real data by fine-tuning with a sample of 101 real clusters with their ICL fraction measured manually using the surface brightness threshold method. With this process, the model is able to effectively learn the task and then adapt its learning to real cluster images. Our model can be directly applied to Hyper Suprime-Cam images, processing up to 500 images in a matter of seconds on a single GPU, or fine-tuned for other imaging surveys such as LSST, with the fine-tuning process taking just 3 minutes. The model could also be retrained to match other ICL measurement methods. Our model and the code for training it are made available on GitHub.},

We find an excellent agreement between the stellar mass surface density profiles of MaNGA and TNG100 ETGs, both in shape and normalization. Moreover, TNG100 reproduces the shapes of the profiles of stellar metallicity and age, as well as the normalization of velocity dispersion distributions of MaNGA ETGs. We generally also find good agreement when comparing the stellar profiles of central and satellite galaxies between MaNGA and TNG100. An exception is the velocity dispersion profiles of very massive (\$M\_*rsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) central galaxies, which, on average, are significantly higher in TNG100 than in MaNGA (\${\textbackslash}approx 50{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$).

  abstract = {The growth of the angular momentum L of protogalaxies induced by tidal torques is reconsidered. We adopt White's formalism and study the evolution of L in Lagrangian coordinates; the motion of the fluid elements is described by the Zel'dovich approximation. We obtain a general expression for the ensemble expectation value of the square of L in terms of the first and second invariant of the inertia tensor of the Lagrangian volume {$\Gamma$} enclosing the collapsing mass of the proto-object. We then specialize the formalism to the particular case in which {$\Gamma$} is centred on a peak of the smoothed Gaussian density field and approximated by an isodensity ellipsoid. The result is the appropriate analytical estimate for the rms angular momentum of peaks to be compared against simulations that make use of the Hoffman-Ribak algorithm to set up a constrained density field that contains a peak with given shape. Extending the work of Heavens \&amp; Peacock, we calculate the joint probability distribution function for several spin parameters and peak mass M using the distribution of peak shapes, for different initial power spectra. The probability distribution for the rms final angular momentum {\textlangle}Lf2{\textrangle}1/2 on the scales corresponding to common bright galaxies, M{$\approx$} l011 M{$\odot$}, is centred on a value of {$\approx$} 1067 kg m2 s-1, for any cosmologically relevant power spectrum, in line with previous theoretical and observational estimates for Lf. Other astrophysical consequences are discussed. In particular, we find that typical values {\textlangle} {$\lambda$}2 {\textrangle}1/2 {$\approx$} 0.1 of the dimensionless spin parameter for peaks smoothed on galactic scales and of height v {$\sim$} 1, usually associated with late-type galaxies, may be recovered in the framework of the Gaussian peak formalism. This partially relaxes the importance attributed to dissipative processes in generating such high values of centrifugal support for spiral galaxies. In addition, the values of the specific angular momentum versus mass --- as deduced from observations of rotational velocities and photometric radii of spiral galaxies --- are well fitted by our theoretical isoprobability contours. In contrast, the observed lower values for the specific angular momentum for ellipticals of the same mass cannot be accounted for within our linear-regime investigation, highlighting the importance of strongly non-linear phenomena to explain the spin of such objects.},

  abstract = {We show with analytic models that the assumption of uncorrelated intrinsic ellipticities of target sources that is usually made in searches for weak gravitational lensing due to large-scale mass inhomogeneities (``field lensing'') is unwarranted. If the orientation of the galaxy image is determined either by the angular momentum or the shape of the halo in which it forms, then the image should be aligned preferentially with the component of the tidal gravitational field perpendicular to the line of sight. Long-range correlations in the tidal field will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity correlations that mimic the shear correlations due to weak gravitational lensing. We calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation expected if halo shapes determine the observed galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which are still considerable) in the predicted amplitude of this correlation. The ellipticity-ellipticity correlation induced by angular momenta should be smaller. We consider several methods for discriminating between the weak-lensing (extrinsic) and intrinsic correlations, including the use of redshift information. An ellipticity--tidal-field correlation also implies the existence of an alignment of images of galaxies near clusters. Although the intrinsic alignment may complicate the interpretation of field-lensing results, it is inherently interesting as it may shed light on galaxy formation as well as on structure formation.},

Most studies focus on the shear and magnification effects since they are more easily observed. In this paper, we focus on the effect of lensing displacements on wide field images. Galaxies at redshifts 0.5-1 are typically displaced by 1 arcmin, and the displacements are coherent over degree-sized patches. However, the displacement effect is redshift dependent, so there is a visible relative shift between galaxies at different redshifts, even if they are close on the sky. We show that the reconstruction of the original galaxy position is now feasible with lensing surveys that cover many hundreds of square degrees. We test with simulations two approaches to `delensing': one uses shear measurements and the other uses the foreground galaxy distribution as a proxy for the mass. We also estimate the effect of foreground deflections on galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements and find it is relevant only for the Large Synoptics Survey Telescope and Euclid-era surveys.},

The sample is selected on the basis of multiple rest-frame colors to reflect low star-formation activity. We demonstrate that these galaxies as an ensemble are dust-poor and transparent and therefore likely have smooth light profiles, similar to visually classified early-type galaxies. Similar to their present-day counterparts, the z {$>$} 1 early-type galaxies show a variety of intrinsic shapes; even at a fixed mass, the projected axis ratio distributions cannot be explained by the random projection of a set of galaxies with very similar intrinsic shapes. However, a two-population model for the intrinsic shapes, consisting of a triaxial, fairly round population, combined with a flat (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.3) oblate population, adequately describes the projected axis ratio distributions of both present-day and z {$>$} 1 early-type galaxies. We find that the proportion of oblate versus triaxial galaxies depends both on the galaxies' stellar mass, and---at a given mass---on redshift. For present-day and z {$<$} 1 early-type galaxies the oblate fraction strongly depends on galaxy mass. At z {$>$} 1, this trend is much weaker over the mass range explored here (1010 {$<$} M */M {$\odot$} {$<$} 1011), because the oblate fraction among massive (M * {\textasciitilde} 1011 M {$\odot$}) was much higher in the past: 0.59 {\textpm} 0.10 at z {$>$} 1, compared to 0.20 {\textpm} 0.02 at z {\textasciitilde} 0.1. When combined with previous findings that the number density and sizes of early-type galaxies substantially increase over the same redshift range, this can be explained by the gradual emergence of merger-produced elliptical galaxies, at the expense of the destruction of pre-existing disks that were common among their high-redshift progenitors. In contrast, the oblate fraction among low-mass early-type galaxies (log (M */M {$\odot$}) {$<$} 10.5) increased toward the present, from z = 0 to 0.38 {\textpm} 0.11 at z {$>$} 1 to 0.72 {\textpm} 0.06 at z = 0. We speculate that this lower incidence of disks at early cosmic times can be attributed to two factors: low-mass, star-forming progenitors at z {$>$} 1 were not settled into stable disks to the same degree as at later cosmic times, and the stripping of gas from star-forming disk galaxies in dense environments is an increasingly important process at lower redshifts.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how fitting of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is carried out within the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's (DESI) 2024 results using its DR1 dataset, and the associated systematic error budget from theory and modelling of the BAO. We derive new results showing how non-linearities in the clustering of galaxies can cause potential biases in measurements of the isotropic (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{iso\}\}\$) and anisotropic (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ap\}\}\$) BAO distance scales, and how these can be effectively removed with an appropriate choice of reconstruction algorithm. We then demonstrate how theory leads to a clear choice for how to model the BAO and develop, implement and validate a new model for the remaining smooth-broadband (i.e., without BAO) component of the galaxy clustering. Finally, we explore the impact of all remaining modelling choices on the BAO constraints from DESI using a suite of high-precision simulations, arriving at a set of best-practices for DESI BAO fits, and an associated theory and modelling systematic error. Overall, our results demonstrate the remarkable robustness of the BAO to all our modelling choices and motivate a combined theory and modelling systematic error contribution to the post-reconstruction DESI BAO measurements of no more than \$0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\$0.2{\textbackslash}\%\$) for its isotropic (anisotropic) distance measurements. We expect the theory and best-practices laid out to here to be applicable to other BAO experiments in the era of DESI and beyond.},

From physics to biology, it tends to be done either through a power spectrum analysis, which is often too limited, or the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which require large training sets and lack interpretability. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the scattering transform (Mallat 2012), a powerful statistic which borrows mathematical ideas from CNNs but does not require any training, and is interpretable. We show that it provides a relatively compact set of summary statistics with visual interpretation and which carries most of the relevant information in a wide range of scientific applications. We present a non-technical introduction to this estimator and we argue that it can benefit data analysis, comparison to models and parameter inference in many fields of science. Interestingly, understanding the core operations of the scattering transform allows one to decipher many key aspects of the inner workings of CNNs.},

To investigate the BCG-ICL transition, we stack the images of {\textasciitilde}3000 clusters between 0.2 {$<$} \${\textbackslash}mathit\{ z\}\$ {$<$} 0.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gri bands, and measure their BCG + ICL stellar surface mass profile \${\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{*\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}texttt \{B+I\}\}\$ down to \$3\{{\textbackslash}times \}10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ at \$R\{{\textbackslash}simeq \}1{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ ({\textasciitilde}32 mag arcsec-2 in the r-band). We develop a physically motivated method to decompose \${\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{*\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}texttt \{B+I\}\}\$ into three components, including an inner de Vaucouleurs' profile, an outer ICL that follows the dark matter distribution measured from weak lensing, and an intriguing transitional component between 70 and 200 kpc. To investigate the origin of this transition, we split the clusters into two subsamples by their BCG stellar mass \$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$ (mass enclosed roughly within 50 kpc) while making sure they have the same distribution of satellite richness. The \${\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{*\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}texttt \{B+I\}\}\$ profiles of the two subsamples differ by more than a factor of 2 at R {$<$} 50 kpc, consistent with their 0.34 dex difference in \$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$, whereas on scales beyond 400 kpc, the two profiles converge to the same amplitudes, suggesting a satellite-stripping origin of the outer ICL. Remarkably, however, the discrepancy between the two \${\textbackslash}Sigma \_\{*\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}texttt \{B+I\}\}\$ profiles persists at above \$50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ level on all scales below 200 kpc, thereby revealing the BCG sphere of influence with radius RSOI {$\simeq$} 200 kpc. Finally, we speculate that the surprisingly large sphere of influence of the BCG is tied to the elevated escape velocity profile within rs, the characteristic radius of the dark matter haloes.},

  abstract = {Profiles of dark matter-dominated halos at the group and cluster scales play an important role in modern cosmology. Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine the halo concentration--mass (c-M) relation over a wide range of masses, employing multiple methods of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles, as well as stacked profiles, relevant for galaxy--galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered is 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4, with a minimum halo mass of M200c {$\sim$} 2 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$}. Despite the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale M{$\star$}(z), we find that a simple non-power-law form for the c--M/M{$\star$} relation provides an excellent description of our simulation results across eight decades in M/M{$\star$} and for 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4. Over the mass range covered, the c--M relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass threshold M/M{$\star$} {$\sim$} 500--1000, transitioning to a constant value, c0 {$\sim$} 3 at higher masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of {$\sim$}0.5 above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; as expected, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with recent weak lensing observations.},

In a joint selection on X-ray and optical observables, the sample contains 455 clusters within a redshift range of 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.2, of which 177 systems are covered by the public data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey that enables uniform weak-lensing cluster mass constraints. With minimal assumptions, at each cluster redshift we empirically model (1) the scaling relations between the cluster halo mass and the observables, which include the X-ray count rate, the optical richness, and the weak-lensing mass, and (2) the X-ray selection in terms of the completeness function \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\$. Using the richness distribution of the clusters, we directly measure the X-ray completeness and adopt those measurements as informative priors for the parameters of \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{C\}\$. In a blinded analysis, we obtain the cosmological constraints \${\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}= 0.245{\textasciicircum}\{+0.048\}\_\{-0.058\}\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma \_\{8\}= 0.833{\textasciicircum}\{+0.075\}\_\{-0.063\}\$, and \$S\_\{8\}{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma \_\{8\}{\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}Omega \_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}/0.3{\textbackslash}right){\textasciicircum}\{0.3\}= 0.791{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Extending to a flat wCDM cosmology leads to the constraint on the equation of state parameter of the dark energy of w = -1.25 {\textpm} 0.47. The eFEDS constraints are in good agreement with the results from the Planck mission, the galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering analysis of the Dark Energy Survey, and the cluster abundance analysis of the SPT-SZ survey at a level of {$\lessequivlnt$} 1{$\sigma$}. With the empirical modelling, this work presents the first fully self-consistent cosmological constraints based on a synergy between wide-field X-ray and weak lensing surveys.},

In this work, we study a sample of 434 optically confirmed galaxy clusters (and groups) at redshift 0.01 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.3 with a median of 0.35, of which 313 systems are uniformly covered by the HSC survey to enable the extraction of the weak-lensing shear observable. In a Bayesian population modeling, we perform a blind analysis for the weak-lensing mass calibration by simultaneously modeling the observed count rate {$\eta$} and the shear profile g+ of individual clusters through the count-rate-to-mass-and-redshift ({$\eta$}-M500-z) relation and the weak-lensing-mass-to-mass-and-redshift (MWL-M500-z) relation, respectively, while accounting for the bias in these observables using simulation-based calibrations. As a result, the count-rate-inferred and lensing-calibrated cluster mass is obtained from the joint modeling of the scaling relations, as the ensemble mass spanning a range of 1013h-1M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} M500 {$\lessequivlnt$} 1015h-1M{$\odot$} with a median of {$\approx$}1014h-1M{$\odot$} for the eFEDS sample. With the mass calibration, we further model the X-ray observable-to-mass-and-redshift relations, including the rest-frame soft-band and bolometric luminosity (LX and Lb), the emission-weighted temperature TX, the mass of intra-cluster medium Mg, and the mass proxy YX, which is the product of TX and Mg. Except for LX with a steeper dependence on the cluster mass at a statistically significant level, we find that the other X-ray scaling relations all show a mass trend that is statistically consistent with the self-similar prediction at a level of {$\lessequivlnt$}1.7{$\sigma$}. Meanwhile, all these scaling relations show no significant deviation from the self-similarity in their redshift scaling. Moreover, no significant redshift-dependent mass trend is present. This work demonstrates the synergy between the eROSITA and HSC surveys in preparation for the forthcoming first-year eROSITA cluster cosmology.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of baryonic processes on the shapes of dark matter (DM) haloes from Illustris, a suite of hydrodynamical (Illustris) and DM-only (Illustris-Dark) cosmological simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. DM halo shapes are determined using an iterative method based on the inertia tensor for a wide range of z = 0 masses (M\_\{200\} = 1 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}-3 {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_{$\odot$}). Convergence tests show that the local DM shape profiles are converged only for r {$>$} 9{$\varepsilon$}, {$\varepsilon$} being the Plummer-equivalent softening length, 1.4 kpc for the highest resolution run. Haloes from non-radiative simulations (neglecting radiative processes, star formation, and feedback) exhibit no alteration in shapes from their DM-only counterparts: thus moving-mesh hydrodynamics alone is insufficient to cause differences in DM shapes. With the full galaxy-physics implementation, baryons result in significantly rounder and more oblate haloes. For halo masses \{{$\lessequivlnt$}\}10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\} M\_\{{$\odot$} \}, the median minor-to-major axial ratio {$\approx$} 0.7, almost invariant throughout the halo. This somewhat improves the agreement between simulation predictions and observational estimates of the Milky Way (MW) halo shape. Consistently, the velocity anisotropy of DM is also reduced in Illustris, across halo masses and radii. Within the inner halo (r = 0.15R200), both s and q (intermediate-to-major axial ratio) exhibit non-monotonicity with galaxy mass, peaking at m\_* {$\approx$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5-11\} M\_{$\odot$}, which we find is due to the strong dependence of inner halo shape with galaxy formation efficiency. Baryons also affect the correlation of halo shape with halo properties, leading to a positive correlation of sphericity of MW-mass haloes with halo formation time and concentration, the latter being mildly more pronounced than in Illustris-Dark.},

A clear red sequence exists for MS galaxies in massive haloes at redshifts z {$<$} 1, and we use this knowledge to inform a cluster-finding algorithm applied to 500h-1Mpc projections of the simulated volume. At low redshift (z = 0.4), we find that 90 per cent of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space halo, and that 10 per cent are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a majority of a cluster's membership. At z = 1, the fraction of blends increases to 22 per cent, as weaker redshift evolution in observed colour extends the comoving length probed by a fixed range of colour. Other factors contributing to the increased blending at high z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a larger number of intermediate-mass haloes hosting bright red galaxies of magnitude similar to those in higher mass haloes. Our method produces catalogues of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M{\textbar}Ngal, z), is characterized by a bimodal lognormal model with a dominant component that reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that is broader and displaced by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 lower in mass. We discuss implications for X-ray properties of optically selected clusters and offer ideas for improving both mock catalogues and cluster finding in future surveys.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ of \$griz\$ imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM) or 7 (for \$w\$CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions, and from their combination obtain \$S\_8 {\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_m/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} = 0.783{\textasciicircum}\{+0.021\}\_\{-0.025\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.264{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.019\}\$ for \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM for \$w\$CDM, we find \$S\_8 = 0.794{\textasciicircum}\{+0.029\}\_\{-0.027\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.279{\textasciicircum}\{+0.043\}\_\{-0.022\}\$, and \$w=-0.80{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\_\{-0.22\}\$ at 68\% CL. The precision of these DES Y1 results rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for \$S\_8\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ are lower than the central values from Planck ...},

  abstract = {The atmospheric depth of the air shower maximum \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$ is an observable commonly used for the determination of the nuclear mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Direct measurements of \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$ are performed using observations of the longitudinal shower development with fluorescence telescopes. At the same time, several methods have been proposed for an indirect estimation of \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$ from the characteristics of the shower particles registered with surface detector arrays. In this paper, we present a deep neural network (DNN) for the estimation of \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$. The reconstruction relies on the signals induced by shower particles in the ground based water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The network architecture features recurrent long short-term memory layers to process the temporal structure of signals and hexagonal convolutions to exploit the symmetry of the surface detector array. We evaluate the performance of the network using air showers simulated with three different hadronic interaction models. Thereafter, we account for long-term detector effects and calibrate the reconstructed \$X\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$ using fluorescence measurements. Finally, we show that the event-by-event resolution in the reconstruction of the shower maximum improves with increasing shower energy and reaches less than \$25{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g/cm{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\$ at energies above \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eV\}\$.},

  abstract = {Which galaxies in the general population turn into active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a keystone of galaxy formation and evolution. Thanks to SRG/eROSITA's contiguous 140 square degree pilot survey field, we constructed a large, complete, and unbiased soft X-ray flux-limited (FX {$>$} 6.5 {\texttimes} 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2) AGN sample at low redshift, 0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.55. Two summary statistics, the clustering using spectra from SDSS-V and galaxy-galaxy lensing with imaging from HSC, are measured and interpreted with halo occupation distribution and abundance matching models. Both models successfully account for the observations. We obtain an exceptionally complete view of the AGN halo occupation distribution. The population of AGNs is broadly distributed among halos with a mean mass of 3.9-2.4+2.0 {\texttimes} 1012 M{$\odot$}. This corresponds to a large-scale halo bias of b(z = 0.34) = 0.99-0.10+0.08. The central occupation has a large transition parameter, {$\sigma$}log10(M) = 1.28 {\textpm} 0.2. The satellite occupation distribution is characterized by a shallow slope, {$\alpha$}sat = 0.73 {\textpm} 0.38. We find that AGNs in satellites are rare, with fsat {$<$} 20\%. Most soft X-ray-selected AGNs are hosted by central galaxies in their dark matter halo. A weak correlation between soft X-ray luminosity and large-scale halo bias is confirmed (3.3{$\sigma$}). We discuss the implications of environmental-dependent AGN triggering. This study paves the way toward fully charting, in the coming decade, the coevolution of X-ray AGNs, their host galaxies, and dark matter halos by combining eROSITA with SDSS-V, 4MOST, DESI, LSST, and Euclid data.},

  abstract = {Aims: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays an important role in galaxy evolution as the main interface between the star-forming body of galaxies and the surrounding cosmic network of in- and out-flowing matter. In this work, we aim to characterize the hot phase of the CGM in a large sample of galaxies using recent soft-X-ray observations made by SRG/eROSITA. Methods: We stack X-ray events from the `eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey' (eFEDS) around central galaxies in the 9hr field of the `GAlaxy and Mass Assembly' (GAMA) survey to construct radially projected X-ray luminosity profiles in the 0.5-2 keV rest frame energy band as a function of their stellar mass and specific star formation rate. We consider samples of quiescent (star-forming) galaxies in the stellar mass range 2 {\texttimes} 1010-1012 M{$\odot$} (3 {\texttimes} 109-6 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$}). Results: For quiescent galaxies, the X-ray profiles are clearly extended throughout the available mass range; however, the measured profile is likely biased high because of projection effects, as these galaxies tend to live in dense and hot environments. For the most massive star-forming samples ({$\geq$}1011 M{$\odot$}), there is a hint of detection of extended emission. On the other hand, for star-forming galaxies with {$<$} 1011 M{$\odot$} the X-ray stacked profiles are compatible with unresolved sources and are consistent with the expected emission from faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries. We measure for the first time the mean relation between average X-ray luminosity and stellar mass separately for quiescent and star-forming galaxies. We find that the relation is different for the two galaxy populations: high-mass ({$\geq$}1011 M{$\odot$}) star-forming or quiescent galaxies follow the expected scaling of virialized hot haloes, while lower mass star-forming galaxies show a less prominent luminosity and a weaker dependence on stellar mass consistent with empirical models of the population of weak AGN. When comparing our results with state-of-the-art numerical simulations (IllustrisTNG and EAGLE), we find overall consistency on the average emission on large ({$>$} 80 kpc) scales at masses {$\geq$}1011 M{$\odot$}, but disagreement on the small scales, where brighter-than-observed compact cores are predicted. The simulations also do not predict the clear differentiation that we observe between quiescent and star-forming galaxies in our samples. Conclusions: This is a stepping stone towards a more profound understanding of the hot phase of the CGM, which holds a key role in the regulation of star formation. Future analysis using eROSITA all-sky survey data, combined with future generation galaxy evolution surveys, shall provide much enhanced quantitative measurements and mapping of the CGM and its hot phase(s).},

  abstract = {The eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission will measure the position and properties of about 100,000 clusters of galaxies and 3 million active galactic nuclei over the full sky. To study the statistical properties of this ongoing survey, it is key to estimate the selection function accurately. We create a set of full sky light-cones using the MultiDark and UNIT dark matter only N-body simulations. We present a novel method to predict the X-ray emission of galaxy clusters. Given a set of dark matter halo properties (mass, redshift, ellipticity, offset parameter), we construct an X-ray emissivity profile and image for each halo in the light-cone. We follow the eROSITA scanning strategy to produce a list of X-ray photons on the full sky. We predict scaling relations for the model clusters, which are in good agreement with the literature. The predicted number density of clusters as a function of flux also agrees with previous measurements. Finally, we obtain a scatter of 0.21 (0.07, 0.25) for the X-ray luminosity -- mass (temperature -- mass, luminosity -- temperature) model scaling relations. We provide catalogues with the model photons emitted by clusters and active galactic nuclei. These catalogues will aid the eROSITA end to end simulation flow analysis and in particular the source detection process and cataloguing methods.},

  abstract = {A simple, observationally motivated model is presented for understanding how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos at multiple epochs, i.e., more massive galaxies are assigned to more massive halos at each epoch. This "abundance matching" technique has been shown previously to reproduce the observed luminosity and scale dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs. Halos at different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories estimated from N-body simulations. The halo-galaxy connection at fixed epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the normalization of the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass relation to z {\textasciitilde} 1. The data demands, for example, that the star formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with M star {$\approx$} 1010.0-10.5 M sun from 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1, and that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M vir {$\approx$} 1011.5-12.5 M sun. The SFR-halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then used to shed light on a number of issues, including (1) a clarification of "downsizing", (2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation is truncated, and (3) the dominance of star formation over merging to the stellar buildup of galaxies with M star lsim 1011 M sun at z {$<$} 1.},

  abstract = {A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to distinguish in a robust, physical, and model-independent way how galaxy populations are physically related to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but distinct, and also long-standing question is whether the structural appearances of galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough physical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of 240 images of nearby galaxies that three model-independent parameters measured on a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes and can be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively measure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's stellar light distribution. When combined into a three-dimensional ``CAS'' volume all major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly distinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important modes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is argued through the strong correlation of H{$\alpha$} equivalent width and broadband colors with the clumpiness parameter S, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66 galaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is to use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that these parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable uncertainty with available data out to z{\textasciitilde}3 using the Hubble Space Telescope GOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.},

  abstract = {We have combined the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Guo et al. with the particle-tagging technique of Cooper et al. to predict galaxy surface brightness profiles in a representative sample of {$\sim$}1900 massive dark matter haloes (1012-1014M{$\odot$}) from the Millennium II {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter N-body simulation. Here, we present our method and basic results focusing on the outer regions of galaxies, consisting of stars accreted in mergers. These simulations cover scales from the stellar haloes of Milky Way-like galaxies to the `cD envelopes' of groups and clusters, and resolve low surface brightness substructure such as tidal streams. We find that the surface density of accreted stellar mass around the central galaxies of dark matter haloes is well described by a S{\`e}rsic profile, the radial scale and amplitude of which vary systematically with halo mass (M200). The total stellar mass surface density profile breaks at the radius where accreted stars start to dominate over stars formed in the galaxy itself. This break disappears with increasing M200 because accreted stars contribute more of the total mass of galaxies, and is less distinct when the same galaxies are averaged in bins of stellar mass, because of scatter in the relation between M{$\star$} and M200. To test our model, we have derived average stellar mass surface density profiles for massive galaxies at z {$\approx$} 0.08 by stacking Sloan Digital Sky Survey images. Our model agrees well with these stacked profiles and with other data from the literature and makes predictions that can be more rigorously tested by future surveys that extend the analysis of the outer structure of galaxies to fainter isophotes. We conclude that it is likely that the outer structure of the spheroidal components of galaxies is largely determined by collisionless merging during their hierarchical assembly.},

  abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function (LF) and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 7 from less than five significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (107-108 Msolar). In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses ({\textasciitilde} 108-109 Msolar) and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes (from 10 to 100 kpc) are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. The central regions ({$<$}10 kpc) of our haloes are highly prolate (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.3), although we find one example of a massive accreted thick disc. Metallicity gradients in our haloes are typically significant only where the halo is built from a small number of satellites. We contrast the ages and metallicities of halo stars with surviving satellites, finding broad agreement with recent observations.},

  abstract = {We present a semi-analytic, physically motivated model for dark matter halo concentration as a function of halo mass and redshift. The semi-analytic model combines an analytic model for the halo mass accretion history (MAH), based on extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, with an empirical relation between concentration and formation time obtained through fits to the results of numerical simulations. Because the semi-analytic model is based on EPS theory, it can be applied to wide ranges in mass, redshift and cosmology. The resulting concentration-mass (c-M) relations are found to agree with the simulations, and because the model applies only to relaxed haloes, they do not exhibit the upturn at high masses or high redshifts found by some recent works. We predict a change of slope in the z {$\sim$} 0 c-M relation at a mass-scale of 1011 M{$\odot$}. We find that this is due to the change in the functional form of the halo MAH, which goes from being dominated by an exponential (for high-mass haloes) to a power law (for low-mass haloes). During the latter phase, the core radius remains approximately constant, and the concentration grows due to the drop of the background density. We also analyse how the c-M relation predicted by this work affects the power produced by dark matter annihilation, finding that at z = 0 the power is two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained from extrapolating best-fitting c-M relations. We provide fits to the c-M relations as well as numerical routines to compute concentrations and MAHs.{\dag}},

Inspection of gri-composite images suggests that the kinematic morphology is a useful proxy for visual morphology. EAGLE produces a galaxy population for which morphology is tightly correlated with the location in the colour-mass diagram, with the red sequence mostly populated by elliptical galaxies and the blue cloud by disc galaxies. Satellite galaxies are more likely to be on the red sequence than centrals, and for satellites the red sequence is morphologically more diverse. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic colour and morphology arises from galaxy-formation models that reproduce the observed galaxy mass function and sizes.},

The SPT follow-up data, calibrating the richness--mass relation of the optically selected redMaPPer catalog, enable the cosmological exploitation of the DES cluster abundance data. To explore possible systematics related to the modeling of projection effects, we consider two calibrations of the observational scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian model which account only for the background contamination (BKG), and a model which further includes contamination and incompleteness due to projection effects (PRJ). Assuming either a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM+\${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\$ or \$w\$CDM+\${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\$ cosmology, and for both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints consistent with multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe, and in particular with the SPT cluster abundance data. This result demonstrates that the DES Y1 and SPT cluster counts provide consistent cosmological constraints, if the same mass calibration data set is adopted. It thus supports the conclusion of the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis which interprets the tension observed with other cosmological probes in terms of systematics affecting the stacked weak lensing analysis of optically--selected low--richness clusters. Finally, we analyse the first combined optically-SZ selected cluster catalogue obtained by including the SPT sample above the maximum redshift probed by the DES Y1 redMaPPer sample. Besides providing a mild improvement of the cosmological constraints, this data combination serves as a stricter test of our scatter models: the PRJ model, providing scaling relations consistent between the two abundance and multi-wavelength follow-up data, is favored over the BKG model.},

  abstract = {We implement the first blind analysis of cluster abundance data to derive cosmological constraints from the abundance and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We simultaneously fit for cosmological parameters and the richness-mass relation of the clusters. For a flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological model with massive neutrinos, we find S\_8 {$\equiv$} {$\sigma$} 8({\textohm} \_ m/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}=0.79{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.04\}. This value is both consistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selected in different wavelengths. Our result is also consistent with the combined probes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies as measured by Planck. We demonstrate that the cosmological posteriors are robust against variation of the richness-mass relation model and to systematics associated with the calibration of the selection function. In combination with baryon acoustic oscillation data and big bang nucleosynthesis data (Cooke et al.), we constrain the Hubble rate to be h = 0.66 {\textpm} 0.02, independent of the CMB. Future work aimed at improving our understanding of the scatter of the richness-mass relation has the potential to significantly improve the precision of our cosmological posteriors. The methods described in this work were developed for use in the forthcoming analysis of cluster abundances in the DES.

  abstract = {The cosmological utility of galaxy cluster catalogues is primarily limited by our ability to calibrate the relation between halo mass and observable mass proxies such as cluster richness, X-ray luminosity or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal. Projection effects are a particularly pernicious systematic effect that can impact observable mass proxies; structure along the line of sight can both bias and increase the scatter of the observable mass proxies used in cluster abundance studies. In this work, we develop an empirical method to characterize the impact of projection effects on redMaPPer cluster catalogues. We use numerical simulations to validate our method and illustrate its robustness. We demonstrate that modeling of projection effects is a necessary component for cluster abundance studies capable of reaching \${\textbackslash}approx 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ mass calibration uncertainties (e.g. the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 sample). Specifically, ignoring the impact of projection effects in the observable--mass relation --- i.e. marginalizing over a log-normal model only --- biases the posterior of the cluster normalization condition \$S\_8 {\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}\$ by \${\textbackslash}Delta S\_8 =0.05\$, more than twice the uncertainty in the posterior for such an analysis.},

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_\{{$\odot$}\} between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations.

In particular, in order to find an observable quantity that could be used to identify early-formed groups, we study the development of the difference in magnitude between their brightest galaxies to assess the use of magnitude gaps as possible indicators. We select galaxy groups and clusters at redshift z = 1 with dark matter halo mass M(R200) {$>$}= 1013 h-1 Msolar, and trace their properties until the present time (z = 0). We consider only the systems with X-ray luminosity LX,bol {$>$}= 0.25 {\texttimes} 1042h-2ergs-1 at redshift z = 0. While it is true that a large magnitude gap between the two brightest galaxies of a particular group often indicates that a large fraction of its mass was assembled at an early epoch, it is not a necessary condition. More than 90per cent of fossil groups defined on the basis of their magnitude gaps (at any epoch between 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 1) cease to be fossils within 4 Gyr, mostly because other massive galaxies are assembled within their cores, even though most of the mass in their haloes might have been assembled at early times. We show that compared to the conventional definition of fossil galaxy groups based on the magnitude gap {$\Delta$} m12 {$>$}= 2 (in the R-band, within 0.5 R200 of the centre of the group), an alternative criterion {$\Delta$} m14 {$>$}= 2.5 (within the same radius) finds 50per cent more early-formed systems, and those that on average retain their fossil phase longer. However, the conventional criterion performs marginally better at finding early-formed groups at the high-mass end of groups. Nevertheless, both criteria fail to identify a majority of the early-formed systems.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that a galaxy's environment has a fundamental influence in shaping its properties. We study the environmental effects on galaxy evolution, with an emphasis on the environment defined as the local number density of galaxies. The density field is estimated with different estimators (weighted adaptive kernel smoothing, 10th and 5th nearest neighbors, Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation) for a Ks {$<$} 24 sample of {$\sim$}190,000 galaxies in the COSMOS field at 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.1. The performance of each estimator is evaluated with extensive simulations. We show that overall there is a good agreement between the estimated density fields using different methods over {$\sim$}2 dex in overdensity values. However, our simulations show that adaptive kernel and Voronoi tessellation outperform other methods. Using the Voronoi tessellation method, we assign surface densities to a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming galaxies out to z {$\sim$} 3. We show that at a fixed stellar mass, the median color of quiescent galaxies does not depend on their host environment out to z {$\sim$} 3. We find that the number and stellar mass density of massive ({$>$}1011 \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}) star-forming galaxies have not significantly changed since z {$\sim$} 3, regardless of their environment. However, for massive quiescent systems at lower redshifts (z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.3), we find a significant evolution in the number and stellar mass densities in denser environments compared to lower density regions. Our results suggest that the relation between stellar mass and local density is more fundamental than the color-density relation and that environment plays a significant role in quenching star-formation activity in galaxies at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.},

The galaxies in the blue cloud and the red sequence are separated at each redshift using a scheme based on Otsu's method. Our analysis shows that the two populations have small differences in the local density and the clustering strength until \$z=2\$, after which the red galaxies preferentially occupy the denser regions and exhibit a significantly stronger clustering than the blue galaxies. The large differences in the cold gas mass and the star formation rate (SFR) of the two populations before \$z=2\$ indicate that the dichotomy between the two populations may not arise due to the environment alone. The galaxy pairs at each redshift show a significantly higher SFR than the isolated control galaxies within pair separations \${$<$}200\$ kpc. The SFR of the paired galaxies at a given separation declines with the decreasing redshift, indicating a gradual depletion of their cold gas reservoir. At smaller pair separations, an anomalous increase of the SFR in paired galaxies around \$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$, suggests that the environmental effects start to dominate at this redshift, increasing the rate of galaxy interactions and the occurrence of starburst galaxies. We observe a substantial decrease in the blue fraction in paired galaxies starting from \$z=1\$ to the present. The decrease in the blue fraction is mild for the paired galaxies with their second nearest neighbour at a distance \${$>$}500\$ kpc.},

Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made.

  abstract = {We quantify two main pathways through which baryonic physics biases cluster count cosmology. We create mock cluster samples that reproduce the baryon content inferred from X-ray observations. We link clusters to their counterparts in a dark matter-only universe, whose abundances can be predicted robustly, by assuming the dark matter density profile is not significantly affected by baryons. We derive weak lensing halo masses and infer the best-fitting cosmological parameters \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$, \$S\_8={\textbackslash}sigma\_8({\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.2\}\$, and \$w\_0\$ from the mock cluster sample. We find that because of the need to accommodate the change in the density profile due to the ejection of baryons, weak lensing mass calibrations are only unbiased if the concentration is left free when fitting the reduced shear with NFW profiles. However, even unbiased total mass estimates give rise to biased cosmological parameters if the measured mass functions are compared with predictions from dark matter-only simulations. This bias dominates for haloes with \$m\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{500c\} {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{14.5\} {\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. For a stage IV-like cluster survey without mass estimation uncertainties, an area \${\textbackslash}approx 15000 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ and a constant mass cut of \$m\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200m,min\} = 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the biases are \$-11 {\textbackslash}pm 1 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$ in \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$, \$-3.29 {\textbackslash}pm 0.04 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$ in \$S\_8\$, and \$9 {\textbackslash}pm 1.5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$ in \$w\_0\$. The statistical significance of the baryonic bias depends on how accurately the actual uncertainty on individual cluster mass estimates is known. We suggest that rather than the total halo mass, the (re-scaled) dark matter mass inferred from the combination of weak lensing and observations of the hot gas, should be used for cluster count cosmology.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints obtained from galaxy clusters identified by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signature in the 2500 square-degree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. We consider the 377 cluster candidates identified at z 0.25 with a detection significance greater than five, corresponding to the 95\% purity threshold for the survey. We compute constraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a function of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from multi-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and a weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling relations. Assuming a spatially flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H 0 and find \{{$\sigma$} \}8=0.784+/- 0.039 and \{\{\{{\textohm} \}\}\}m=0.289+/- 0.042, with the parameter combination \{{$\sigma$} \}8\{(\{\{\{{\textohm} \}\}\}m/0.27)\}0.3=0.797+/- 0.031. These results are in good agreement with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with constraints from other cluster data sets. We also consider several extensions to {$\Lambda$}CDM, including models in which the equation of state of dark energy w, the species-summed neutrino mass, and/or the effective number of relativistic species (\{N\}\{eff\}) are free parameters. When combined with constraints from the Planck CMB, H 0, baryon acoustic oscillation, and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data improves the w constraint by 14\%, to w=-1.023+/- 0.042.},

  abstract = {Massive galaxies in the young Universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids. Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are `stream-fed galaxies', formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes. A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duty cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid. This stream-driven scenario for the formation of discs and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture.},

  abstract = {We study the survival versus disruption of the giant clumps in high-redshift disc galaxies, short-lived (S) versus long-lived (L) clumps and two L sub-types, via analytic modeling tested against simulations. We develop a criterion for clump survival, with or without their gas, based on a predictive survivability parameter \$S\$. It compares the energy sources by supernova feedback and gravitational contraction to the clump binding energy and losses by outflows and turbulence dissipation. The clump properties are derived from Toomre instability, approaching virial and Jeans equilibrium, and the supernova energy deposit is based on an up-to-date bubble analysis. For moderate feedback levels, we find that L clumps exist with circular velocities \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}!50{\textbackslash}, km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and masses \${\textbackslash}geq{\textbackslash}!10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. They are likely in galaxies with circular velocities \${\textbackslash}geq {\textbackslash}!200{\textbackslash}, km{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, consistent at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$ with the favored stellar mass for discs, \${\textbackslash}geq{\textbackslash}!10{\textasciicircum}\{9.3\}{\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. L clumps favor disc gas fractions \${\textbackslash}geq{\textbackslash}!0.3\$, low-mass bulges and redshifts \$z{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}! 2\$. The likelihood of L clumps is reduced if the feedback is more ejective, e.g., if the supernovae are optimally clustered, if radiative feedback is very strong, if the stellar initial mass function is top-heavy, or if the star-formation-rate efficiency is particularly high. A sub-type of L clumps (LS), which lose their gas in several free-fall times but retain bound stellar components, may be explained by a smaller contraction factor and stronger external gravitational effects, where clump mergers increase the SFR efficiency. The more massive L clumps (LL) retain most of their baryons for tens of free-fall times with a roughly constant star-formation rate.},

  abstract = {We propose a general formalism for galaxy biasing and apply it to methods for measuring cosmological parameters, such as regression of light versus mass, the analysis of redshift distortions, measures involving skewness, and the cosmic virial theorem. The common linear and deterministic relation g=b{$\delta$} between the density fluctuation fields of galaxies g and mass {$\delta$} is replaced by the conditional distribution P(g{\textbar}{$\delta$}) of these random fields, smoothed at a given scale at a given time. The nonlinearity is characterized by the conditional mean {$\equiv$}b({$\delta$}){$\delta$}, while the local scatter is represented by the conditional variance {$\sigma$}2b({$\delta$}) and higher moments. The scatter arises from hidden factors affecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it has been properly removed. For applications involving second-order local moments, the biasing is defined by three natural parameters: the slope {\^b} of the regression of g on {$\delta$}, a nonlinearity b{$\sim$}, and a scatter {$\sigma$}b. The ratio of variances b2var and the correlation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity and the scatter lead to underestimates of order b{$\sim$}2/{\^b}2 and {$\sigma$}2b/{\^b}2 in the different estimators of {$\beta$} ({\textasciitilde}{\textohm}0.6/{\^b}). The nonlinear effects are typically smaller. Local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis only by limiting the useful range of scales, especially for power spectra. In this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis reduces to Kaiser's formula for {\^b} (not bvar), independent of the scatter. The distortion analysis is affected by nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way. Estimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations and toy models, and strategies for measuring them are discussed. They may partly explain the range of estimates for {$\beta$}.},

  abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z {\textasciitilde} 5, 80 per cent at z {\textasciitilde} 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z {\textasciitilde} 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counterparts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

For each catalog, we use a computationally efficient empirical approach, ADDGALS, to embed galaxies within light-cone outputs of three dark matter simulations that resolve halos with masses above {\textasciitilde}5x10{\textasciicircum}12 h{\textasciicircum}-1 m\_sun at z {$<$}= 0.32 and 10{\textasciicircum}13 h{\textasciicircum}-1 m\_sun at z{\textasciitilde}2. The embedding method is tuned to match the observed evolution of galaxy counts at different luminosities as well as the spatial clustering of the galaxy population. Galaxies are lensed by matter along the line of sight --- including magnification, shear, and multiple images --- using CALCLENS, an algorithm that calculates shear with 0.42 arcmin resolution at galaxy positions in the full catalog. The catalogs presented here, each with the same LCDM cosmology (denoted Buzzard), contain on average 820 million galaxies over an area of 1120 square degrees with positions, magnitudes, shapes, photometric errors, and photometric redshift estimates. We show that the weak-lensing shear catalog, redMaGiC galaxy catalogs and redMaPPer cluster catalogs provide plausible realizations of the same catalogs in the DES Y1 data by comparing their magnitude, color and redshift distributions, angular clustering, and mass-observable relations, making them useful for testing analyses that use these samples. We make public the galaxy samples appropriate for the DES Y1 data, as well as the data vectors used for cosmology analyses on these simulations.},

The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

  abstract = {The relation between halo mass, M, and concentration, c, is a critical component in our understanding of the structure of dark matter halos. While numerous models for this relation have been proposed, almost none of them attempt to derive the evolution of the relation analytically. We build on previous efforts to model the c-M relation as a function of physical parameters such as the peak height, {$\nu$}, and the effective power spectrum slope, \{n\}eff\vphantom\{\}, which capture the dependence of c on halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We present three major improvements over previous models. First, we derive an analytical expression for the c-M relation that is valid under the assumption of pseudo-evolution, i.e., assuming that the density profiles of halos are static in physical coordinates while the definition of their boundary evolves. We find that this ansatz is highly successful in describing the evolution of the low-mass end of the c-M relation. Second, we employ a new physical variable, the effective exponent of linear growth, \{{$\alpha$} \}eff\vphantom\{\}, to parameterize deviations from an Einstein-de Sitter expansion history. Third, we combine an updated definition of \{n\}eff\vphantom\{\} with the additional dependence on \{{$\alpha$} \}eff\vphantom\{\} and propose a phenomenological extension of our analytical framework to include all halo masses. This semianalytical model matches simulated concentrations in both scale-free models and {$\Lambda$}CDM to 5\% accuracy with very few exceptions and differs significantly from all previously proposed models. We present a publicly available code to compute the predictions of our model in the python toolkit COLOSSUS, including updated parameters for the model of Diemer and Kravtsov.},

  abstract = {We have recently developed a post-processing framework to estimate the abundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen (H I and H2, respectively) in galaxies in large-volume cosmological simulations. Here we compare the H I and H2 content of IllustrisTNG galaxies to observations. We mostly restrict this comparison to z {$\approx$} 0 and consider six observational metrics: the overall abundance of H I and H2, their mass functions, gas fractions as a function of stellar mass, the correlation between H2 and star formation rate, the spatial distribution of gas, and the correlation between gas content and morphology. We find generally good agreement between simulations and observations, particularly for the gas fractions and the H I mass-size relation. The H2 mass correlates with star formation rate as expected, revealing an almost constant depletion time that evolves up to z = 2 as observed. However, we also discover a number of tensions with varying degrees of significance, including an overestimate of the total neutral gas abundance at z = 0 by about a factor of 2 and a possible excess of satellites with no or very little neutral gas. These conclusions are robust to the modelling of the H I/H2 transition. In terms of their neutral gas properties, the IllustrisTNG simulations represent an enormous improvement over the original Illustris run. All data used in this paper are publicly available as part of the IllustrisTNG data release.},

The cosmology module implements Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, COLOSSUS implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with particular emphasis on their accuracy. COLOSSUS is available at bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus.},

We show that the median and mean profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r {$>$} 0.5 R200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r {\textasciitilde} R200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r {$>$} R200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy {$<$} 10\% at all radii, redshifts and masses we studied, r {$<$} 9 Rvir, 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6 and Mvir {$>$} 1.7E10 Msun/h. We discuss observational signatures of the profile features described above, and show that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in future weak-lensing analyses of massive clusters. Such observations could be used to estimate the mass accretion rate of cluster halos.},

  abstract = {The density profiles of dark matter haloes can potentially probe dynamics, fundamental physics, and cosmology, but some of the most promising signals reside near or beyond the virial radius. While these scales have recently become observable, the profiles at large radii are still poorly understood theoretically, chiefly because the distribution of orbiting matter (the one-halo term) is partially concealed by particles falling into halos for the first time. We present an algorithm to dynamically disentangle the orbiting and infalling contributions by counting the pericentric passages of billions of simulation particles. We analyse dynamically split profiles out to 10 R200m across a wide range of halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We show that the orbiting term experiences a sharp truncation at the edge of the orbit distribution. Its sharpness and position are mostly determined by the mass accretion rate, confirming that the entire profile shape primarily depends on halo dynamics and secondarily on mass, redshift, and cosmology. The infalling term also depends on the accretion rate for fast-accreting haloes but is mostly set by the environment for slowly accreting haloes, leading to a diverse array of shapes that does not conform to simple theoretical models. While the resulting scatter in the infalling term reaches 1 dex, the scatter in the orbiting term is only between 0.1 and 0.4 dex and almost independent of radius. We demonstrate a tight correspondence between the redshift evolution in LCDM and the slope of the matter power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a log-normal function in time, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their conjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and on observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores short-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the majority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85\% of the cumulative SFHs are fitted to within a maximum error of 5\% of the total stellar mass formed, and 99\% to within 10\%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the commonly used delayed-{$\tau$} model, and is superseded only by functions with more than three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were rapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the log-normal parameter space of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find that the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though Illustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of log-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of Illustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts their quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not determined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight relation, where \{width\} {\textbackslash}propto \{(\{peak\}\{time\})\}3/2. We show that such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively) by a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their galaxies.},

Within this general framework, we develop an algorithm that accurately extracts the location of the first apocenter of particles after infall into a halo, or splashback. We define the splashback radius of a halo as the smoothed average of the apocenter radii of individual particles. This definition allows us to reliably measure the splashback radii of 95\% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000 particles.

  abstract = {Virtually any investigation involving dark matter halos relies on a definition of their radius, of their mass, and of whether they are a subhalo. The halo boundary is most commonly defined to include a spherical overdensity contrast (such as \$\{R\}\_\{200\{{\textbackslash}rm\{c\}\}\}\$ , \$\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ , and \$\{R\}\_\{200\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}\$ ), but different thresholds lead to significant differences in radius and mass. The splashback radius has recently been suggested as a more physically motivated (and generally larger) halo boundary, adding to the range of definitions. It is often difficult to assess the impact of a particular choice because most halo catalogs contain only one or a few definitions and generally only one set of host-subhalo relations. To alleviate this issue, we present halo catalogs and merger trees for 14 N-body simulations of {$\Lambda$}CDM and self-similar universes. Based on ROCKSTAR catalogs, we compute additional halo properties using the SPARTA code and recombine them with the original catalogs. The new catalogs contain numerous variants of spherical overdensity and splashback radii and masses and, most critically, host-subhalo relations for each definition. We also present a new merger tree format where the data are stored as a compressed, two-dimensional matrix. We perform basic tests of the relation between different definitions and present an updated model for the splashback-spherical overdensity connection. The SPARTA code, as well as our catalogs and merger trees, are publicly available.},

Many theoretical models (such as Press-Schechter theory) are based on the notion that it could be universal, meaning independent of redshift and cosmology, when expressed in the appropriate variables. However, simulations exhibit persistent nonuniversalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the first time including the recently proposed splashback mass, \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{sp\}\}\$ . We confirm that, in {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of nonuniversality that increase with peak height and reach between 20\% and 500\% at the highest masses we can test. \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{vir\}\}\$ , \$\{M\}\_\{200\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}\$ , and \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{sp\}\}\$ exhibit similar levels of nonuniversality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10\% at \$z{\textbackslash}leqslant 2\$ , whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal (to between 40\% and 60\%), whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach nonuniversalities between 180\% and 450\%. These results strongly support the notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the halo boundary. We present a simple and universal fitting formula for splashback mass functions that accurately reproduces our simulation data.},

  abstract = {The new Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA X-ray telescope has a superior response to extended soft X-rays in terms of effective area, energy resolution, and field-of-view (FoV). This makes SRG/eROSITA ideal for studying low X-ray surface brightness emission of cosmic filaments. We search for extended X-ray emission between the two nearby galaxy clusters Abell 3667 and Abell 3651 that are separated by a projected transverse distance of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 13{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$, using data from the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Detailed X-ray image analysis of the region between the two galaxy clusters and redshift analysis of sources between them is performed. We carried out thorough surface brightness analysis between the clusters and in their outskirts studying enhanced emission in different directions. The analysis is complemented with an X-ray pointed observation from XMM-Newton, infrared 2MASS data and redshift information from NED. We discover an emission filament beyond the known radio relic in the northwest of A3667 and even beyond three times its virial radius, smoothly connecting to A3651. The X-ray emission in the direction of the filament shows a \$30{\textbackslash}pm3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ enhancement with a significance of \$11{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$. The 2MASS map and redshift analysis show an alignment of sources along the filament and make a projection effect unlikely. Taking the redshift progression of sources within the filament into account, its three-dimensional length is estimated to be in the range of \$25{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\} - 32{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$. Surface brightness analysis in combination with assumptions for ranges of plausible temperatures and metallicities leads to estimates of total flux, gas mass and central baryon overdensity of \$F\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{X\}= (7.1{\textasciicircum}\{+2.1\}\_\{-1.0\}){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$, \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{g\}=(2.8{\textasciicircum}\{+5.4\}\_\{-1.0\}){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}delta\_0=220{\textasciicircum}\{+390\}\_\{-65\}\$, respectively.},

  abstract = {Kinematic weak lensing describes the distortion of a galaxy's projected velocity field due to lensing shear, an effect recently reported for the first time by Gurri et al. based on a sample of 18 galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.1\$. In this paper, we develop a new formalism that combines the shape information from imaging surveys with the kinematic information from resolved spectroscopy to better constrain the lensing distortion of source galaxies and to potentially address systematic errors that affect conventional weak-lensing analyses. Using a Bayesian forward model applied to mock galaxy observations, we model distortions in the source galaxy's velocity field simultaneously with the apparent shear-induced offset between the kinematic and photometric major axes. We show that this combination dramatically reduces the statistical uncertainty on the inferred shear, yielding statistical error gains of a factor of 2--6 compared to kinematics alone. While we have not accounted for errors from intrinsic kinematic irregularities, our approach opens kinematic lensing studies to higher redshifts where resolved spectroscopy is more challenging. For example, we show that ground-based integral-field spectroscopy of background galaxies at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.7\$ can deliver gravitational shear measurements with S/N \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ per source galaxy at 1 arcminute separations from a galaxy cluster at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.3\$. This suggests that even modest samples observed with existing instruments could deliver improved galaxy cluster mass measurements and well-sampled probes of their halo mass profiles to large radii.},

Their origin and chemical composition remain a mystery. As we show here, the large and intermediate angular scale anisotropies observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory are a powerful tool for understanding the origin of UHECRs. Without specifying any particular production mechanism but only postulating that the source distribution follows the matter distribution of the local universe, a good accounting of the magnitude, direction, and energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy at energies above 8 {\texttimes} 1018 eV is obtained after taking into account the impact of energy losses during propagation (the "GZK horizon"), diffusion in the extragalactic magnetic field, and deflections in the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). This is a major step toward the long-standing hope of using UHECR anisotropies to constrain UHECR composition and magnetic fields. The observed dipole anisotropy is incompatible with a pure proton composition in this scenario. With a more accurate treatment of energy losses, it should be possible to further constrain the cosmic-ray composition and properties of the extragalactic magnetic field, self-consistently improve the GMF model, and potentially expose individual UHECR sources.},

Ongoing and upcoming surveys will start to identify the underlying physics of these new phenomena, including tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy, the viability of modified gravity, the existence of extra light species, the masses of the neutrinos, and the potential of the field that drove inflation. Even after the Stage IV experiments, DESI and LSST, complete their surveys, there will still be much information left in the sky. This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime. These ideas flow to potential projects that could start construction in the 2020's.},

  abstract = {The abundance and structure of dark matter subhaloes have been analysed extensively in recent studies of dark-matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the SUBFIND algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhaloes when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one per cent, of subhaloes within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. The fraction of mass contributed by gas in subhaloes is found to increase with the cluster-centric distance. Interestingly, this trend extends well beyond the virial radii, thus showing that galaxies feel the environment of the pressurized cluster gas over fairly large distances. The compact stellar cores (i.e. galaxies) are generally more resistant against tidal disruption than pure dark matter subhaloes. Still, the fraction of star-dominated substructures within our simulated clusters is only {\textasciitilde}10 per cent. We expect that the finite resolution in our simulations makes the galaxies overly susceptible to tidal disruption, hence the above fraction of star-dominated galaxies should represent a lower limit for the actual fraction of galaxies surviving the disruption of their host dark matter subhalo.},

We quantify the systematic uncertainties related to different criteria to classify star-forming versus quiescent galaxies, different SFR estimates, and by accounting for the star formation measured within different physical apertures. The TNG model returns the observed features of the UVJ diagram at z {$\leq$} 2, with a clear separation between two classes of galaxies. It also returns a tight star-forming main sequence (MS) for M\_stars{$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} (M\_{$\odot$}) with a {$\sim$}0.3 dex scatter at z {$\sim$} 0 in our fiducial choices. If a UVJ-based cut is adopted, the TNG MS exhibits a downwardly bending at stellar masses of about 1010.5-10.7 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, the model predicts that \{{$\sim$} \}80 (50) per cent of 1010.5-11 M{$\odot$} galaxies at z = 0 (z = 2) are quiescent and the numbers of quenched galaxies at intermediate redshifts and high masses are in better agreement with observational estimates than previous models. However, shorter SFR-averaging time-scales imply higher normalizations and scatter of the MS, while smaller apertures lead to underestimating the galaxy SFRs: overall we estimate the inspected systematic uncertainties to sum up to about 0.2-0.3 dex in the locus of the MS and to about 15 percentage points in the fraction of quenched galaxies. While TNG colour distributions are clearly bimodal, this is not the case for the SFR logarithmic distributions in bins of stellar mass (SFR {$\greaterequivlnt$} 10-3 M{$\odot$}yr-1). Finally, the slope and z = 0 normalization of the TNG MS are consistent with observational findings; however, the locus of the TNG MS remains lower by about 0.2-0.5 dex at 0.75 {$\leq$} z {$<$} 2 than the available observational estimates taken at face value.},

  abstract = {Cosmic acceleration is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. Testing and distinguishing among possible explanations requires cosmological measurements of extremely high precision probing the full history of cosmic expansion and structure growth and, ideally, compare and contrast matter and relativistic tracers of the gravity potential. This program is one of the defining objectives of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), as set forth in the New Worlds, New Horizons report (NWNH) in 2010. The WFIRST mission has the ability to improve these measurements by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, while simultaneously extending their redshift grasp, greatly improving control of systematic effects, and taking a unified approach to multiple probes that provide complementary physical information and cross-checks of cosmological results. We describe in this annual report the activities of the Science Investigation Team (SIT) "Cosmology with the High Latitude Survey (HLS)" during the year 2017. This team was selected by NASA in December 2015 in order to address the stringent challenges of the WFIRST dark energy (DE) program through the Project's formulation phase. This SIT has elected to jointly address Galaxy Redshift Survey, Weak Lensing and Cluster Growth and thus fully embrace the fact that the imaging and spectroscopic elements of the HLS will be realized as an integrated observing program, and they jointly impose requirements on performance and operations. WFIRST is designed to be able to deliver a definitive result on the origin of cosmic acceleration. It is not optimized for Figure of Merit sensitivity but for control of systematic uncertainties and for having multiple techniques each with multiple cross-checks. Our SIT work focuses on understanding the potential systematics in the WFIRST DE measurements.},

Taken collectively, the ``morphology-density'' relationship, T - {$\Sigma$}, for these more distant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found for the local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences: (1) For the clusters in our sample, the T - {$\Sigma$} relation is strong in centrally concentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radius and surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentrated and irregular, in contrast to the situation for low-redshift clusters, where a strong relation has been found for both. (2) In every cluster the fraction of elliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, but the S0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of the spiral fraction. Straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretations of these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceeds hierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2) the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but S0's are generated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.

Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

  abstract = {The interplay between cosmic gas accretion on to galaxies and galaxy mergers drives the observed morphological diversity of galaxies. By comparing the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations HORIZON-AGN and HORIZON-NOAGN, we unambiguously identify the critical role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in setting up the correct galaxy morphology for the massive end of the population. With AGN feedback, typical kinematic and morpho-metric properties of galaxy populations as well as the galaxy-halo mass relation are in much better agreement with observations. Only AGN feedback allows massive galaxies at the centre of groups and clusters to become ellipticals, while without AGN feedback those galaxies reform discs. It is the merger-enhanced AGN activity that is able to freeze the morphological type of the post-merger remnant by durably quenching its quiescent star formation. Hence morphology is shown to be driven not only by mass but also by the nature of cosmic accretion: at constant galaxy mass, ellipticals are galaxies that are mainly assembled through mergers, while discs are preferentially built from the in situ star formation fed by smooth cosmic gas infall.},

  abstract = {Using high-resolution N-body simulations, we recently reported that a dynamically cool inner disk embedded in a hotter outer disk can naturally generate a steady double-barred (S2B) structure. Here we study the kinematics of these S2B simulations, and compare them to integral-field observations from ATLAS 3D and SAURON. We show that S2B galaxies exhibit several distinct kinematic features, namely: (1) significantly distorted isovelocity contours at the transition region between the two bars, (2) peaks in {$\sigma$} LOS along the minor axis of inner bars, which we term ``{$\sigma$}-humps,'' that are often accompanied by ring/spiral-like features of increased {$\sigma$} LOS, (3) \{h\}3\{--\}{\textbackslash}bar\{v\} anti-correlations in the region of the inner bar for certain orientations, and (4) rings of positive h 4 when viewed at low inclinations. The most impressive of these features are the {$\sigma$}-humps these evolve with the inner bar, oscillating in strength just as the inner bar does as it rotates relative to the outer bar. We show that, in cylindrical coordinates, the inner bar has similar streaming motions and velocity dispersion properties as normal large-scale bars, except for {$\sigma$} z , which exhibits peaks on the minor axis, I.e., humps. These {$\sigma$} z humps are responsible for producing the {$\sigma$}-humps. For three well-resolved early-type S2Bs (NGC 2859, NGC 2950, and NGC 3941) and a potential S2B candidate (NGC 3384), the S2B model qualitatively matches the integral-field data well, including the ``{$\sigma$}-hollows'' previously identified. We also discuss the kinematic effect of a nuclear disk in S2Bs.},

Flows based on either coupling or autoregressive transforms both offer exact density evaluation and sampling, but rely on the parameterization of an easily invertible elementwise transformation, whose choice determines the flexibility of these models. Building upon recent work, we propose a fully-differentiable module based on monotonic rational-quadratic splines, which enhances the flexibility of both coupling and autoregressive transforms while retaining analytic invertibility. We demonstrate that neural spline flows improve density estimation, variational inference, and generative modeling of images.},

(2) The energy or mass of light is subject to gravitation in the same way as ordinary matter. If the law of gravitation is strictly the Newtonian law, this leads to an apparent displacement of a star close to the sun's limb amounting to 0"{$\cdot$}87 outwards. (3) The course of a, ray of light is in accordance with Einstein's generalised relativity theory. This leads to an apparent displacement of a star at the limb amounting to 1"{$\cdot$}75 outwards. In either of the last two cases the displacement is inversely proportional to the distance of the star from the sun's centre, the displacement under (3) being just double the displacement under (2).},

In particular, we quantify environmental effects on satellite populations from TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 located within the virial radius of group- and cluster-like hosts with total masses of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!15.2\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ . At fixed stellar mass, the satellite SHMR exhibits a distinct shift towards lower dynamical mass compared to the SHMR of centrals. Conversely, at fixed dynamical mass, satellite galaxies appear to have larger stellar-to-total mass fractions than centrals by up to a factor of a few. The systematic deviation from the central SHMR is larger for satellites in more massive hosts, at smaller cluster-centric distances, with earlier infall times, and that inhabits higher local density environments; moreover, it is in place already at early times (z {$\lessequivlnt$} 2). Systematic environmental effects might contribute to the perceived galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the measured SHMR when galaxies cannot be separated into satellites and centrals. The SHMR of satellites exhibits a larger scatter than centrals (by up to {$\sim$}0.8 dex), over the whole range of dynamical mass. The shift of the satellite SHMR results mostly from tidal stripping of their dark matter, which affects satellites in an outside-in fashion: The departure of the satellite SHMR from the centrals' relation diminishes for measurements of dynamical mass in progressively smaller apertures. Finally, we provide a family of fitting functions for the SHMR predicted by IllustrisTNG.},

  abstract = {Cosmological analyses using galaxy clusters in optical/NIR photometric surveys require robust characterization of their galaxy content. Precisely determining which galaxies belong to a cluster is crucial. In this paper, we present the COlor Probabilistic Assignment of Clusters And BAyesiaN Analysis (Copacabana) algorithm. Copacabana computes membership probabilities for \{{\textbackslash}it all\} galaxies within an aperture centred on the cluster using photometric redshifts, colours, and projected radial probability density functions. We use simulations to validate Copacabana and we show that it achieves up to 89{\textbackslash}\% membership accuracy with a mild dependency on photometric redshift uncertainties and choice of aperture size. We find that the precision of the photometric redshifts has the largest impact on the determination of the membership probabilities followed by the choice of the cluster aperture size. We also quantify how much these uncertainties in the membership probabilities affect the stellar mass--cluster mass scaling relation, a relation that directly impacts cosmology. Using the sum of the stellar masses weighted by membership probabilities (\${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$) as the observable, we find that Copacabana can reach an accuracy of 0.06 dex in the measurement of the scaling relation. These results indicate the potential of Copacabana and \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ to be used in cosmological analyses of optically selected clusters in the future.},

  abstract = {We investigate the level of accuracy and precision of cluster weak-lensing (WL) masses measured with the {\textbackslash}Euclid data processing pipeline. We use the DEMNUni-Cov \$N\$-body simulations to assess how well the WL mass probes the true halo mass, and, then, how well WL masses can be recovered in the presence of measurement uncertainties. We consider different halo mass density models, priors, and mass point estimates. WL mass differs from true mass due to, e.g., the intrinsic ellipticity of sources, correlated or uncorrelated matter and large-scale structure, halo triaxiality and orientation, and merging or irregular morphology. In an ideal scenario without observational or measurement errors, the maximum likelihood estimator is the most accurate, with WL masses biased low by \${\textbackslash}langle b\_M {\textbackslash}rangle = -14.6 {\textbackslash}pm 1.7 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$ on average over the full range \$M\_{\textbackslash}text\{200c\} {$>$} 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}, M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$z {$<$} 1\$. Due to the stabilising effect of the prior, the biweight, mean, and median estimates are more precise. The scatter decreases with increasing mass and informative priors significantly reduce the scatter. Halo mass density profiles with a truncation provide better fits to the lensing signal, while the accuracy and precision are not significantly affected. We further investigate the impact of additional sources of systematic uncertainty on the WL mass, namely the impact of photometric redshift uncertainties and source selection, the expected performance of {\textbackslash}Euclid cluster detection algorithms, and the presence of masks. Taken in isolation, we find that the largest effect is induced by non-conservative source selection. This effect can be mostly removed with a robust selection. As a final {\textbackslash}Euclid-like test, we combine systematic effects in a realistic observational setting and find results similar to the ideal case, \${\textbackslash}langle b\_M {\textbackslash}rangle = - 15.5 {\textbackslash}pm 2.4 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}\%\$, under a robust selection.},

  abstract = {We describe an updated calibration and diagnostic framework, Balrog, used to directly sample the selection and photometric biases of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 (Y3) data set. We systematically inject onto the single-epoch images of a random 20\% subset of the DES footprint an ensemble of nearly 30 million realistic galaxy models derived from DES Deep Field observations. These augmented images are analyzed in parallel with the original data to automatically inherit measurement systematics that are often too difficult to capture with generative models. The resulting object catalog is a Monte Carlo sampling of the DES transfer function and is used as a powerful diagnostic and calibration tool for a variety of DES Y3 science, particularly for the calibration of the photometric redshifts of distant "source" galaxies and magnification biases of nearer "lens" galaxies. The recovered Balrog injections are shown to closely match the photometric property distributions of the Y3 GOLD catalog, particularly in color, and capture the number density fluctuations from observing conditions of the real data within 1\% for a typical galaxy sample. We find that Y3 colors are extremely well calibrated, typically within {\textasciitilde}1-8 mmag, but for a small subset of objects, we detect significant magnitude biases correlated with large overestimates of the injected object size due to proximity effects and blending. We discuss approaches to extend the current methodology to capture more aspects of the transfer function and reach full coverage of the survey footprint for future analyses.},

  abstract = {The massive dark matter halos that host groups and clusters of galaxies have observable properties that appear to be log-normally distributed about power-law mean scaling relations in halo mass. Coupling this assumption with either quadratic or cubic approximations to the mass function in log space, we derive closed-form expressions for the space density of halos as a function of multiple observables as well as forms for the low-order moments of properties of observable-selected samples. Using a Tinker mass function in a \{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}CDM cosmology, we show that the cubic analytic model reproduces results obtained from direct, numerical convolution at the 10 percent level or better over nearly the full range of observables covered by current observations and for redshifts extending to z = 1.5. The model provides an efficient framework for estimating effects arising from selection and covariance among observable properties in survey samples.},

Several properties of these formulae are examined, including the relations between the first two moments of the distributions. The results are then applied to measurements of the axial ratios of globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galaxy from a previous investigation. It is found that the clusters in the LMC with ages smaller than their relaxation time scales are as flat on average as elliptical galaxies, whereas the older clusters in the LMC and in the Galaxy are much rounder. On the reasonable assumption that the older clusters have isotropic velocity distributions and oblate forms, their kinematic properties are simply related to the observed axial ratios. The available evidence suggests that globular clusters have a smaller fraction of their kinetic energy in rotation than faint elliptical galaxies and a larger fraction than bright elliptical galaxies. The results have several interesting consequences for the formation and evolution of the two types of stellar systems.},

This variability is an indicator of diversity in the formation history of these dark matter halos that is reflected in the coupling of scatters about the mean relations. In this work, we show that the strength of this coupling depends on the scale at which halo profiles are measured. By analyzing the outputs of the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we report the radial- and mass-dependent couplings between the dark matter, hot gas, and stellar mass radial density profiles utilizing the population diversity in dark matter halos. We find that for the same mass halos, the scatters in the density of baryons and dark matter are strongly coupled at large scales (r {$>$} R 200), but the coupling between gas and dark matter density profiles fades near the core of halos (r {$<$} 0.3R 200). We then show that the correlation between halo profile and integrated quantities induces a radius-dependent additive bias in the profile observables of halos when halos are selected on properties other than their mass. We discuss the impact of this effect on cluster abundance and cross-correlation cosmology with multiwavelength cosmological surveys.},

Hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the highest-mass systems retain the cosmic fraction of baryons, a natural consequence of which is anti-correlation between the masses of hot gas and stars within dark matter halos of fixed total mass. We report observational detection of this anti-correlation based on 4 elements of a 9 {\texttimes} 9-element covariance matrix for nine cluster properties, measured from multi-wavelength observations of 41 clusters from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey. These clusters were selected using explicit and quantitative selection rules that were then encoded in our hierarchical Bayesian model. Our detection of anti-correlation is consistent with predictions from contemporary hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that were not tuned to reproduce this signal.},

The halo mass scale inferred by applying the virial scaling of Evrard et~al. to the velocity normalization matches, to within a few per cent, the log-mean halo mass derived through galaxy membership matching. We apply this approach, along with miscentring and galaxy velocity bias corrections, to estimate the log-mean matched halo mass at z = 0.2 of SDSS redMaPPer clusters. Employing the velocity bias constraints of Guo et~al., we find {\textlangle}ln\,(M200c){\textbar}{$\lambda\rangle$} = ln\,(M30) + {$\alpha$}m\,ln\,({$\lambda$}/30) with M30 = 1.56 {\textpm} 0.35 {\texttimes} 1014\,M{$\odot$} and {$\alpha$}m = 1.31 {\textpm} 0.06stat {\textpm} 0.13sys.

Consequently, quantifying the statistical relationships between system-level observable properties of a population offers insights into the astrophysical drivers of that class of systems. While purely linear models capture behavior over a limited range of system scale, the fact that astrophysics is ultimately scale-dependent implies the need for a more flexible approach to describing population statistics over a wide dynamic range. For such applications, we introduce and implement a class of Kernel-Localized Linear Regression (KLLR) models. KLLR is a natural extension to the commonly-used linear models that allows the parameters of the linear model -- normalization, slope, and covariance matrix -- to be scale-dependent. KLLR performs inference in two steps: (1) it estimates the mean relation between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable and; (2) it estimates the conditional covariance of the dependent variables given a set of independent variables. We demonstrate the model's performance in a simulated setting and showcase an application of the proposed model in analyzing the baryonic content of dark matter halos. As a part of this work, we publicly release a Python implementation of the KLLR method.},

Here we report the discovery of distant RR Lyrae stars, including some of the most distant stars known in the Milky Way halo, with Galactocentric distances of {$\sim$}300 kpc. We use time-series \$\{u\}{\textasciicircum}\{* \}g{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} i{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} z{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\} \$ Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope/MegaCam photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). We use a template light-curve fitting method based on empirical Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 RR Lyrae data to identify RR Lyrae candidates in the NGVS data set. We eliminate several hundred suspected quasars and identify 180 RR Lyrae candidates with heliocentric distances of {$\sim$}20--300 kpc. The halo stellar density distribution is consistent with an r -4.09{\textpm}0.10 power-law radial profile over most of this distance range with no signs of a break. The distribution of ab-type RR Lyrae in a period--amplitude plot (Bailey diagram) suggests that the mean metallicity of the halo decreases outward. Compared to other recent RR Lyrae surveys, like Pan-STARRS1, the High Cadence Transient Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey, our NGVS study has better single-epoch photometric precision and a comparable number of epochs but smaller sky coverage. At large distances, our RR Lyrae sample appears to be relatively pure and complete, with well-measured periods and amplitudes. These newly discovered distant RR Lyrae stars are important additions to the few secure stellar tracers beyond 150 kpc in the Milky Way halo.},

Aims: We aim to determine differences in density estimation methods and their applicability in astronomical problems. We study the performance of four density estimation techniques: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), adaptive Gaussian kernel density estimation (DEDICA), a special case of adaptive Epanechnikov kernel density estimation (MBE), and the Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE). Methods: The density estimators are applied to six artificial datasets and on three astronomical datasets, the Millennium Simulation and two samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the performance of the methods in two ways: first, by measuring the integrated squared error and Kullback-Leibler divergence of each of the methods with the parametric densities of the datasets (in case of the artificial datasets); second, by examining the applicability of the densities to study the properties of galaxies in relation to their environment (for the SDSS datasets). Results: The adaptive kernel based methods, especially MBE, perform better than the other methods in terms of calculating the density properly and have stronger predictive power in astronomical use cases. Conclusions: We recommend the modified Breiman estimator as a fast and reliable method to quantify the environment of galaxies.},

Thanks to a dedicated data acquisition strategy and processing pipeline, the NGVS reaches a point-source depth of g {$\approx$} 25.9 mag (10{$\sigma$}) and a surface brightness limit of {$\mu$} g {\textasciitilde} 29 mag arcsec-2 (2{$\sigma$} above the mean sky level), thus superseding all previous optical studies of this benchmark galaxy cluster. In this paper, we give an overview of the technical aspects of the survey, such as areal coverage, field placement, choice of filters, limiting magnitudes, observing strategies, data processing and calibration pipelines, survey timeline, and data products. We also describe the primary scientific topics of the NGVS, which include: the galaxy luminosity and mass functions; the color-magnitude relation; galaxy scaling relations; compact stellar systems; galactic nuclei; the extragalactic distance scale; the large-scale environment of the cluster and its relationship to the Local Supercluster; diffuse light and the intracluster medium; galaxy interactions and evolutionary processes; and extragalactic star clusters. In addition, we describe a number of ancillary programs dealing with "foreground" and "background" science topics, including the study of high-inclination trans-Neptunian objects; the structure of the Galactic halo in the direction of the Virgo Overdensity and Sagittarius Stream; the measurement of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy, and cluster lensing; and the identification of distant galaxy clusters, and strong-lensing events.

  abstract = {Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, though at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope point-spread function (PSF) when mapped back to the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time- and resource-intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may be well preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can be made in the image plane.},

  abstract = {We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of stellar spheroids of Milky Way mass disc galaxies. The simulations contain accurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have been simulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of {$\approx$}400 simulated {$\sim$}L* disc galaxies. The simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low surface brightness stellar haloes that extend out to {$\sim$}100 kpc and beyond. The diffuse stellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed around the Milky Way, M31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surface brightness and metallicity profiles. We show that in situ star formation typically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r{$\lessequivlnt$} 30 kpc, whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origin induces a change in the slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles, which is also present in the observational data. The system-to-system scatter in the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans over a factor of 4. Consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shape and normalization of the spheroid density profile within r{$\lessequivlnt$} 30 kpc (e.g. when fitted by a spherical power-law profile, the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). We show that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formation epoch of the system. Dynamically, older systems have, on average, larger contributions from in situ star formation, although there is significant system-to-system scatter in this relationship. Thus, in situ star formation likely represents the solution to the long-standing failure of pure accretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the inner spheroid.},

  abstract = {Correlated orientations of quasar optical and radio polarisation, and of radio jets, have been reported on Gpc scales, possibly arising from intrinsic alignment of spin axes. Optical quasar polarisation appears to be preferentially either aligned or orthogonal to the host large-scale structure, specifically large quasar groups (LQGs). Using a sample of 71 LQGs at redshifts \$1.0 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 1.8\$, we investigate whether LQGs themselves exhibit correlated orientation. We find that LQG position angles (PAs) are unlikely to be drawn from a uniform distribution (\$p\$-values \$0.008 {\textbackslash}lesssim p {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.07\$). The LQG PA distribution is bimodal, with median modes at \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}theta\}{\textbackslash}sim45{\textbackslash}pm2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}, 136{\textbackslash}pm2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, remarkably close to the mean angles of quasar radio polarisation reported in two regions coincident with our LQG sample. We quantify the degree of alignment in the PA data, and find that LQGs are aligned and orthogonal across very large scales. The maximum significance is \${\textbackslash}simeq 0.8{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\$2.4{\textbackslash}sigma\$) at typical angular (proper) separations of \${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ (1.6 Gpc). If the LQG orientation correlation is real, it represents large-scale structure alignment over scales larger than those predicted by cosmological simulations and at least an order of magnitude larger than any so far observed, with the exception of quasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment. We conclude that LQG alignment helps explain quasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment, but raises challenging questions about the origin of the LQG correlation and the assumptions of the concordance cosmological model.},

  abstract = {We describe and test the fiducial covariance matrix model for the combined two-point function analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES-Y3) data set. Using a variety of new ansatzes for covariance modelling and testing, we validate the assumptions and approximations of this model. These include the assumption of Gaussian likelihood, the trispectrum contribution to the covariance, the impact of evaluating the model at a wrong set of parameters, the impact of masking and survey geometry, deviations from Poissonian shot noise, galaxy weighting schemes, and other sub-dominant effects. We find that our covariance model is robust and that its approximations have little impact on goodness of fit and parameter estimation. The largest impact on best-fitting figure-of-merit arises from the so-called fsky approximation for dealing with finite survey area, which on average increases the {$\chi$}2 between maximum posterior model and measurement by \$3.7\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ ({$\Delta\chi$}2 {$\approx$} 18.9). Standard methods to go beyond this approximation fail for DES-Y3, but we derive an approximate scheme to deal with these features. For parameter estimation, our ignorance of the exact parameters at which to evaluate our covariance model causes the dominant effect. We find that it increases the scatter of maximum posterior values for {\textohm}m and {$\sigma$}8 by about \$3\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter by about \$5\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$.},

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from \$O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$ to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$. Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

  abstract = {In cosmological N-body simulations, the representation of dark matter as discrete `macroparticles' suppresses the growth of structure, such that simulations no longer reproduce linear theory on small scales near kNyquist. Marcos et~al. demonstrate that this is due to sparse sampling of modes near kNyquist and that the often-assumed continuum growing modes are not proper growing modes of the particle system. We develop initial conditions (ICs) that respect the particle linear theory growing modes and then rescale the mode amplitudes to account for growth suppression. These ICs also allow us to take advantage of our very accurate N-body code abacus to implement second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) in configuration space. The combination of 2LPT and rescaling improves the accuracy of the late-time power spectra, halo mass functions, and halo clustering. In particular, we achieve 1~per~cent accuracy in the power spectrum down to kNyquist, versus kNyquist/4 without rescaling or kNyquist/13 without 2LPT, relative to an oversampled reference simulation. We anticipate that our 2LPT will be useful for large simulations where fast Fourier transforms are expensive and that rescaling will be useful for suites of medium-resolution simulations used in cosmic emulators and galaxy survey mock catalogues. Code to generate ICs is available at https://github.com/lgarrison/zeldovich-PLT.},

  abstract = {We present the calibration of the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) weak lensing (WL) source galaxy redshift distributions n(z) from clustering measurements. In particular, we cross-correlate the WL source galaxies sample with redMaGiC galaxies (luminous red galaxies with secure photometric redshifts) and a spectroscopic sample from BOSS/eBOSS to estimate the redshift distribution of the DES sources sample. Two distinct methods for using the clustering statistics are described. The first uses the clustering information independently to estimate the mean redshift of the source galaxies within a redshift window, as done in the DES Y1 analysis. The second method establishes a likelihood of the clustering data as a function of n(z), which can be incorporated into schemes for generating samples of n(z) subject to combined clustering and photometric constraints. Both methods incorporate marginalization over various astrophysical systematics, including magnification and redshift-dependent galaxy-matter bias. We characterize the uncertainties of the methods in simulations; the first method recovers the mean z of tomographic bins to RMS (precision) of {\textasciitilde}0.014. Use of the second method is shown to vastly improve the accuracy of the shape of n(z) derived from photometric data. The two methods are then applied to the DES Y3 data.},

  abstract = {We measure the impact of source galaxy clustering on higher order summary statistics of weak gravitational lensing data. By comparing simulated data with galaxies that either trace or do not trace the underlying density field, we show that this effect can exceed measurement uncertainties for common higher order statistics for certain analysis choices. We evaluate the impact on different weak lensing observables, finding that third moments and wavelet phase harmonics are more affected than peak count statistics. Using Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 (Y3) data, we construct null tests for the source-clustering-free case, finding a p-value of p = 4 {\texttimes} 10-3 (2.6{$\sigma$}) using third-order map moments and p = 3 {\texttimes} 10-11 (6.5{$\sigma$}) using wavelet phase harmonics. The impact of source clustering on cosmological inference can be either included in the model or minimized through ad hoc procedures (e.g. scale cuts). We verify that the procedures adopted in existing DES Y3 cosmological analyses were sufficient to render this effect negligible. Failing to account for source clustering can significantly impact cosmological inference from higher order gravitational lensing statistics, e.g. higher order N-point functions, wavelet-moment observables, and deep learning or field-level summary statistics of weak lensing maps.},

However, a perennial problem has been the mapping of optical `richness' measurements onto total cluster mass3,9--12. Emitted at a conformal distance of 14~gigaparsecs, the cosmic microwave background acts as a backlight to all intervening mass in the Universe, and therefore has been gravitationally lensed13--15. Experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope16, South Pole Telescope17--19and the Planck20satellite have now detected gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background and produced large-area maps of the foreground deflecting structures. Here we present a calibration of cluster optical richness at the 10\% level by measuring the average cosmic microwave background lensing measured by Planck towards the positions of large numbers of optically selected clusters, detecting the deflection of photons by structures of total mass of order 1014~M{$\odot$}. Although mainly aimed at the study of larger-scale structures, the Planck estimate of the cosmic microwave background lensing field can be used to recover a nearly unbiased lensing signal for stacked clusters on arcminute scales15,21. This approach offers a clean measure of total cluster masses over most of cosmic history, largely independent of baryon physics.},

We find that the angular momentum of the simulated galaxies matches observations well, and in particular two distinct relations are found for late-type versus early-type galaxies. The relation for late-type galaxies corresponds to the value expected from full conservation of the specific angular momentum generated by cosmological tidal torques. The relation for early-type galaxies corresponds to retention of only {$\sim$}30\% of that, but we find that those early-type galaxies with low angular momentum at z = 0 nevertheless reside at high redshift on the late-type relation. Some of them abruptly lose angular momentum during major mergers. To gain further insight, we explore the scaling relations in simulations where the galaxy formation physics is modified with respect to the fiducial model. We find that galactic winds with high mass-loading factors are essential for obtaining the high angular momentum relation typical for late-type galaxies, while active galactic nucleus feedback largely operates in the opposite direction. Hence, feedback controls the stellar angular momentum of galaxies, and appears to be instrumental for establishing the Hubble sequence.},

Observational qualitative trends of size with stellar mass, star formation rate and redshift are reproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r band sizes at 0 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 2 shows agreement to much better than 0.25 dex. We follow populations of z = 0 galaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor branches, distinguishing between main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main findings are as follows. (i) At M*, z = 0 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 109.5 M{$\odot$}, the evolution of the median main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median size before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size continuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies. This is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched z = 0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the overall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched galaxies with M*, z = 0 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 109.5 M{$\odot$} experience a steep size growth on the size-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception of galaxies with M*, z = 0 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1011 M{$\odot$}, the size growth after quenching is small in absolute terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched galaxies (and its variation among them) occurs while they are still on the main sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth rate of quenched galaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that of main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z = 0.},

The common footprint region between the eROSITA Survey and DES, KiDS, and HSC surveys is used for calibration of the scaling between X-ray count rate and their total mass through measurements of their weak gravitational lensing signal. eRASS1 cluster abundances constrain the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM parameters, which are the energy density of the total matter to \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\}=0.29{\textasciicircum}\{+0.01\}\_\{-0.02\}\$, and the normalization of the density fluctuations to \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8=0.88{\textbackslash}pm0.02\$ and their combination yields \$S\_8={\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\} / 0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\}=0.86{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$, consistent and at a similar precision with the state-of-the-art CMB measurements. eRASS1 cosmological experiment places a most stringent upper limit on the summed masses of left-handed light neutrinos to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{$<$} 0.22{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}eV\}\$ (95{\textbackslash}\% confidence interval). Combining eRASS1 cluster abundance measurements with CMB and ground-based neutrino oscillation experiments, we measure the summed neutrino masses to be \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu=0.08\_\{-0.02\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.03\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}eV\}\$ or \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu=0.12\_\{-0.01\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.03\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}eV\}\$ depending on the mass hierarchy scenario for neutrino eigenstates. eRASS1 cluster abundances significantly improve the constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter to \$w=-1.12{\textbackslash}pm0.12\$.

In this review, we provide a summary and some new results concerning bounds among ten important probability metrics/distances that are used by statisticians and probabilists. We focus on these metrics because they are either well-known, commonly used, or admit practical bounding techniques. We summarize these relationships in a handy reference diagram, and also give examples to show how rates of convergence can depend on the metric chosen.},

Covering an area of 50 deg2, the survey contains several hundred galaxy clusters out to a redshift of {\textasciitilde}2 above an X-ray flux limit of {\textasciitilde}5 {\texttimes} 10-15 erg cm-2 s-1. This paper belongs to the first series of XXL papers focusing on the bright cluster sample. Aims: We investigate the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation for the brightest clusters detected in the XXL Survey, taking fully into account the selection biases. We investigate the form of the LT relation, placing constraints on its evolution. Methods: We have classified the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey based on their measured X-ray flux. These 100 clusters have been analysed to determine their luminosity and temperature to evaluate the LT relation. We used three methods to fit the form of the LT relation, with two of these methods providing a prescription to fully take into account the selection effects of the survey. We measure the evolution of the LT relation internally using the broad redshift range of the sample. Results: Taking fully into account selection effects, we find a slope of the bolometric LT relation of BLT = 3.08 {\textpm} 0.15, steeper than the self-similar expectation (BLT = 2). Our best-fit result for the evolution factor is E(z)1.64 {\textpm} 0.77, fully consistent with "strong self-similar" evolution where clusters scale self-similarly with both mass and redshift. However, this result is marginally stronger than "weak self-similar" evolution, where clusters scale with redshift alone. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the assumptions made in our fitting model, finding that using an external LT relation as a low-z baseline can have a profound effect on the measured evolution. However, more clusters are needed in order to break the degeneracy between the choice of likelihood model and mass-temperature relation on the derived evolution.

Covering an area of 50 deg2, the survey contains several hundred galaxy clusters out to a redshift of {$\approx$}2, above an X-ray flux limit of {\textasciitilde}6 {\texttimes} 10-15 er g cm-2 s-1. The GAMA spectroscopic survey of {\textasciitilde}300 000 galaxies covers {$\approx$}286 deg2, down to an r-band magnitude of r {$<$} 19.8 mag. The region of overlap of these two surveys (covering 14.6 deg2) represents an ideal opportunity to study clusters selected via two independent selection criteria. Generating two independently selected samples of clusters, one drawn from XXL (spanning a redshift range 0.05 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 0.3) and another from GAMA (0.05 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 0.2), both spanning 0.2 {$\lessequivlnt$} M500 {$\lessequivlnt$} 5 {\texttimes} 1014 M{$\odot$}, we investigate the relationship between X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion (LX - {$\sigma$}v relation). Comparing the LX - {$\sigma$}v relation between the X-ray selected and optically selected samples, when not accounting for the X-ray selection, we find that the scatter of the X-ray selected sample is 2.7 times higher than the optically selected sample (at the 3.7{$\sigma$} level). Accounting for the X-ray selection to model the LX - {$\sigma$}v relation, we find that the difference in the scatter increases (with the X-ray selected sample having a scatter 3.4 times larger than the optically selected sample). Although the scatter of the optically selected sample is lower, we find 13 optically selected GAMA groups undetected in X-rays. Inspection of the difference in magnitude between the first and second brightest galaxies in the cluster, and a stacked X-ray image of these 13 groups, suggests that these are young systems still in the process of forming.},

The clumps are classified as long-lived clumps (LLCs) or short-lived clumps (SLCs) based on their longevity in the simulations. We then train neural networks to detect and classify the simulated clumps in mock, multicolour, dusty, and noisy HST-like images. The clumps are detected using an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN), and are classified according to their longevity using a vanilla CNN. Tests using the simulations show our detector and classifier to be \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ complete and \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ pure for clumps more massive than {$\sim$}107.5 M{$\odot$}. When applied to observed galaxies in the CANDELS/GOODS S+N fields, we find both types of clumps to appear in similar abundances in the simulations and the observations. LLCs are, on average, more massive than SLCs by {$\sim$}0.5 dex, and they dominate the clump population above Mc {$\greaterequivlnt$} 107.6 M{$\odot$}. LLCs tend to be found closer to the galactic centre, indicating clump migration to the centre or preferential formation at smaller radii. The LLCs are found to reside in high-mass galaxies, indicating better clump survivability under supernova feedback there, due to clumps being more massive in these galaxies. We find the clump masses and radial positions in the simulations and the observations to agree within a factor of 2.},

  abstract = {Shot noise is an important ingredient to any measurement or theoretical modeling of discrete tracers of the large scale structure. Recent work has shown that the shot noise in the halo power spectrum becomes increasingly sub-Poissonian at high mass. Interestingly, while the halo model predicts a shot noise power spectrum in qualitative agreement with the data, it leads to an unphysical white noise in the cross halo-matter and matter power spectrum. In this work, we show that absorbing all the halo model sources of shot noise into the halo fluctuation field leads to meaningful predictions for the shot noise contributions to halo clustering statistics and remove the unphysical white noise from the cross halo-matter statistics. Our prescription straightforwardly maps onto the general bias expansion, so that the renormalized shot noise terms can be expressed as combinations of the halo model shot noises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Poissonian contributions are related to volume integrals over correlation functions and their response to long-wavelength density perturbations. This leads to a new class of consistency relations for discrete tracers, which appear to be satisfied by our reformulation of the halo model. We test our theoretical predictions against measurements of halo shot noise bispectra extracted from a large suite of numerical simulations. Our model reproduces qualitatively the observed sub-Poissonian noise, although it underestimates the magnitude of this effect.},

In this paper, we present an emulator for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. The emulator is based on the baryonification model, containing seven free parameters that are connected to the gas profiles and stellar abundances in haloes. We show that with the baryonic emulator, we can not only recover the power spectra of hydro-dynamical simulations at sub-percent precision but also establish a connection between the baryonic suppression of the power spectrum and the gas and stellar fractions in haloes. This connection allows us to predict the expected deviation from a dark-matter-only power spectrum using measured X-ray gas fractions of galaxy groups and clusters. With these measurements, we constrain the suppression to exceed the percent-level at k = 0.1-0.4 h/Mpc and to reach a maximum of 20-28 percent at around k = 7 h/Mpc (68 percent confidence level). As a further step, we also perform a detailed parameter study and we present a minimum set of four baryonic parameters that are required to recover the scale and redshift dependence observed in hydro-dynamical simulations.

The value of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) is critical as it determines the UHECR cosmic horizon. We calculate the UHECR sky maps for different values of the IGMF variance and show the effect of the UHECR horizon on the observed anisotropy. The footprint of the local ({$\lessequivlnt$} 350 Mpc) Universe on the UHECR background, a small angular scale enhancement in the Northern hemisphere, is seen. At 11.5 EeV (the median value of the energy bin at which the dipole has been reported), the LSS-induced dipole amplitude is A\_1{$\sim$} 10\{\{ per cent\}\}, for IGMF in the range [0.3-3] nG for protons, helium and nitrogen, compatible with the rms value derived from the cosmic power spectrum. However at these energies, the UHECRs are also influenced by the Galactic magnetic field and we discuss its effect on the LSS-induced anisotropy.},

Over this redshift range, we measure no change in the ICL's stellar content (between 50 and 300 kpc) in clusters with log10(M200m,SZ/M{$\odot$}) {$>$}14.4. We also measure the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation for the BCG+ICL system and find that the slope, {$\beta$}, which characterizes the dependence of M200m,SZ on the BCG+ICL stellar mass, increases with radius. The outskirts are more strongly correlated with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system follows a two-phase growth, where recent growth (z {$<$} 2) occurs beyond the BCG's core. Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the IllustrisTNG300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate qualitative agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM relation's slope is steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower, likely from the absence of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we find that the ICL exhibits a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer than the core. Moreover, for the lower halo mass clusters (log10(M200m,SZ/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 14.59), we detect a modest change in the colour gradient's slope with lookback time, which combined with the absence of stellar mass growth may suggest that lower mass clusters have been involved in growth via tidal stripping more recently than their higher mass counterparts.},

To quantify hierarchical formation we use the stellar mass - halo mass (SMHM) relation for the BCG+ICL system and incorporate the magnitude gap (M14), the difference in brightness between the BCG (measured within 30kpc) and 4th brightest cluster member galaxy within 0.5 \$R\_\{200,c\}\$. The inclusion of M14, which traces BCG hierarchical growth, increases the slope and decreases the intrinsic scatter in the SMHM relation, highlighting that it is a latent variable within the BCG+ICL SMHM relation. Moreover, the correlation with M14 decreases at large radii from the BCG's centre. However, the stellar light within the BCG+ICL transition region (30kpc - 80kpc) most strongly correlates with the dark matter halo mass and has a statistically significant correlation with M14. As the light in the transition region and M14 are independent measurements, the transition region may grow as a result of the BCG's hierarchical two-phase formation. Additionally, as M14 and ICL result from hierarchical growth, we use a stacked sample and find that clusters with large M14 values are characterized by larger ICL and BCG+ICL fractions, which illustrates that the merger processes that build the BCG stellar mass also grow the ICL. Furthermore, this may suggest that M14 combined with the ICL fraction can be used as a method to identify dynamically relaxed clusters.},

Major improvements compared with previous work are: (i) automated galaxy morphology classification capable of separating galaxies into four types; (ii) three-dimensional local galaxy density estimation; and (iii) the extension of the morphology-density relation into the field region. We found that the morphology-density and morphology-cluster-centric-radius relation in the SDSS data for both of our automated morphological classifiers, Cin and Tauto, as fractions of early-type galaxies increase and late-type galaxies decrease toward increasing local galaxy density. In addition, we found that there are two characteristic changes in both the morphology-density and the morphology-radius relations, suggesting that two different mechanisms are responsible for the relations. In the sparsest regions (below 1 Mpc-2 or outside of 1 virial radius), both relations become less noticeable, suggesting that the physical mechanisms responsible for galaxy morphological change require a denser environment. In the intermediate-density regions (density between 1 and 6 Mpc-2 or virial radius between 0.3 and 1), intermediate-type fractions increase toward denser regions, whereas late-disc fractions decrease. Considering that the median size of intermediate-type galaxies is smaller than that of late-disc galaxies, we propose that the mechanism is likely to stop star formation in late-disc galaxies, eventually turning them into intermediate-type galaxies after their outer discs and spiral arms become invisible as stars die. For example, ram-pressure stripping is one of the candidate mechanisms. In the densest regions (above 6 Mpc-2 or inside 0.3 virial radii), intermediate-type fractions decrease radically and early-type fractions increase in turn. This is a contrasting result to that in intermediate regions and it suggests that yet another mechanism is more responsible for the morphological change in these regions. We also compared the morphology-density relation from the SDSS (0.01},

  abstract = {Cosmological inference from cluster number counts is systematically limited by the accuracy of the mass calibration, i.e. the empirical determination of the mapping between cluster selection observables and halo mass. In this work we demonstrate a method to quantitatively determine the bias and uncertainties in weak-lensing (WL) mass calibration. To this end, we extract a library of projected matter density profiles from hydrodynamical simulations. Accounting for shear bias and noise, photometric redshift uncertainties, mis-centreing, cluster member contamination, cluster morphological diversity, and line-of-sight projections, we produce a library of shear profiles. Fitting a one-parameter model to these profiles, we extract the so-called WL mass MWL. Relating the WL mass to the halo mass from gravity-only simulations with the same initial conditions as the hydrodynamical simulations allows us to estimate the impact of hydrodynamical effects on cluster number counts experiments. Creating new shear libraries for {\textasciitilde}1000 different realizations of the systematics provides a distribution of the parameters of the WL to halo mass relation, reflecting their systematic uncertainty. This result can be used as a prior for cosmological inference. We also discuss the impact of the inner fitting radius on the accuracy, and determine the outer fitting radius necessary to exclude the signal from neighbouring structures. Our method is currently being applied to different Stage III lensing surveys, and can easily be extended to Stage IV lensing surveys.},

  abstract = {The redistribution of baryonic matter in massive halos through processes like active galactic nuclei feedback and star formation leads to a suppression of the matter power spectrum on small scales. This redistribution can be measured empirically via the gas and stellar mass fractions in galaxy clusters, and leaves imprints on their electron density profiles. We constrain two semi-analytical baryon correction models with a compilation of recent Bayesian population studies of galaxy groups and clusters sampling a mass range above \${\textbackslash}sim 3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and with cluster gas density profiles derived from deep, high-resolution X-ray observations. We are able to fit all the considered observational data, but highlight some anomalies in the observations. The constraints allow us to place precise, physically informed priors on the matter power spectrum suppression. At a scale of \$k=1 h\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ we find a suppression of \$0.042{\textasciicircum}\{+0.012\}\_\{-0.014\}\$ (\$0.049{\textasciicircum}\{+0.016\}\_\{-0.012\}\$), while at \$k=3h\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ we find \$0.184{\textasciicircum}\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ (\$0.179{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.020\}\$), depending on the model used. We also predict at 97.5 percent credibility, that at scales \$k{$<$}0.37h\$ Mpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ baryon feedback impacts the matter power less than \$1{\textbackslash}\%\$. This puts into question if baryon feedback is the driving factor for the discrepancy between cosmic shear and primary CMB results. We independently confirm results on this suppression from small-scale cosmic shear studies, while we exclude some hydro-dynamical simulations with too strong and too weak baryonic feedback. Our empirical prediction of the power spectrum suppression shows that studies of galaxy groups and clusters will be instrumental in unlocking the cosmological constraining power of future cosmic shear experiments like {\textbackslash}textit\{Euclid\} and Rubin-LSST.},

Of the 1005 redMaPPer selected clusters with measured richness \${\textbackslash}hat{\textbackslash}lambda{$>$}40\$ in the joint footprint, 207 are confirmed by SPT-SZ. Using the mass information from the SZE signal, we calibrate the richness--mass relation using a Bayesian cluster population model. We find a mass trend \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{B\}\$ consistent with a linear relation (\$B{\textbackslash}sim1\$), no significant redshift evolution and an intrinsic scatter in richness of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda\} = 0.22{\textbackslash}pm0.06\$. At low richness SPT-SZ confirms fewer redMaPPer clusters than expected. We interpret this richness dependent deficit in confirmed systems as due to the increased presence at low richness of low mass objects not correctly accounted for by our richness-mass scatter model, which we call contaminants. At a richness \${\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}lambda=40\$, this population makes up \${$>\$$}12\${\textbackslash}\%\$ (97.5 percentile) of the total population. Extrapolating this to a measured richness \${\textbackslash}hat {\textbackslash}lambda=20\$ yields \${$>\$$}22\${\textbackslash}\%\$ (97.5 percentile). With these contamination fractions, the predicted redMaPPer number counts in different plausible cosmologies are compatible with the measured abundance. The presence of such a population is also a plausible explanation for the different mass trends (\$B{\textbackslash}sim0.75\$) obtained from mass calibration using purely optically selected clusters. The mean mass from stacked weak lensing (WL) measurements suggests that these low mass contaminants are galaxy groups with masses \${\textbackslash}sim3\$-\$5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} \$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ which are beyond the sensitivity of current SZE and X-ray surveys but a natural target for SPT-3G and eROSITA.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters selected based on overdensities of galaxies in photometric surveys provide the largest cluster samples. Yet modeling the selection function of such samples is complicated by non-cluster members projected along the line of sight (projection effects) and the potential detection of unvirialized objects (contamination). We empirically constrain the magnitude of these effects by cross-matching galaxy clusters selected in the Dark Energy survey data with the {\textbackslash}rdmpr\${\textbackslash},\$ algorithm with significant detections in three South Pole Telescope surveys (SZ, pol-ECS, pol-500d). For matched clusters, we augment the {\textbackslash}rdmpr\${\textbackslash},\$catalog by the SPT detection significance. For unmatched objects we use the SPT detection threshold as an upper limit on the SZe signature. Using a Bayesian population model applied to the collected multi-wavelength data, we explore various physically motivated models to describe the relationship between observed richness and halo mass. Our analysis reveals the limitations of a simple lognormal scatter model in describing the data. We rule out significant contamination by unvirialized objects at the high-richness end of the sample. While dedicated simulations offer a well-fitting calibration of projection effects, our findings suggest the presence of redshift-dependent trends that these simulations may not have captured. Our findings highlight that modeling the selection function of optically detected clusters remains a complicated challenge, requiring a combination of simulation and data-driven approaches.},

  abstract = {Number counts of galaxy clusters across redshift are a powerful cosmological probe, if a precise and accurate reconstruction of the underlying mass distribution is performed -- a challenge called mass calibration. With the advent of wide and deep photometric surveys, weak gravitational lensing by clusters has become the method of choice to perform this measurement. We measure and validate the weak gravitational lensing (WL) signature in the shape of galaxies observed in the first 3 years of the DES Y3 caused by galaxy clusters selected in the first all-sky survey performed by SRG/eROSITA. These data are then used to determine the scaling between X-ray photon count rate of the clusters and their halo mass and redshift. We empirically determine the degree of cluster member contamination in our background source sample. The individual cluster shear profiles are then analysed with a Bayesian population model that self-consistently accounts for the lens sample selection and contamination, and includes marginalization over a host of instrumental and astrophysical systematics. To quantify the accuracy of the mass extraction of that model, we perform mass measurements on mock cluster catalogs with realistic synthetic shear profiles. This allows us to establish that hydro-dynamical modelling uncertainties at low lens redshifts (\$z{$<$}0.6\$) are the dominant systematic limitation. At high lens redshift the uncertainties of the sources' photometric redshift calibration dominate. With regard to the X-ray count rate to halo mass relation, we constrain all its parameters. This work sets the stage for a joint analysis with the number counts of eRASS1 clusters to constrain a host of cosmological parameters. We demonstrate that WL mass calibration of galaxy clusters can be performed successfully with source galaxies whose calibration was performed primarily for cosmic shear experiments.},

This sample was selected through optical follow-up of the 2nd ROSAT faint source catalog (2RXS) with Dark Energy Survey year 3 (DES-Y3) data. The selection function is modeled by combining an empirically constructed X-ray selection function with an incompleteness model for the optical follow-up. We validate the joint selection function by testing the consistency of the constraints on the X-ray flux--mass and richness--mass scaling relation parameters derived from different sources of mass information: (1) cross-calibration using SPT-SZ clusters, (2) calibration using number counts in X-ray, in optical and in both X-ray and optical while marginalizing over cosmological parameters, and (3) other published analyses. We find that the constraints on the scaling relation from the number counts and SPT-SZ cross-calibration agree, indicating that our modeling of the selection function is adequate. Furthermore, we apply a largely cosmology independent method to validate selection functions via the computation of the probability of finding each cluster in the SPT-SZ sample in the MARD-Y3 sample and vice-versa. This test reveals no clear evidence for MARD-Y3 contamination, SPT-SZ incompleteness or outlier fraction. Finally, we discuss the prospects of the techniques presented here to limit systematic selection effects in future cluster cosmological studies.},

Different novel manycore architectures have emerged in recent years on the way towards the exascale era. Performance portability is required to prevent repeated non-trivial refactoring of a code for different architectures. We combine Athena++, an existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) CPU code, with Kokkos, a performance portable on-node parallel programming paradigm, into K-Athena to allow efficient simulations on multiple architectures using a single codebase. We present profiling and scaling results for different platforms including Intel Skylake CPUs, Intel Xeon Phis, and NVIDIA GPUs. K-Athena achieves \${$>$}10{\textasciicircum}8\$ cell-updates/s on a single V100 GPU for second-order double precision MHD calculations, and a speedup of 30 on up to 24,576 GPUs on Summit (compared to 172,032 CPU cores), reaching \$1.94{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ total cell-updates/s at 76\% parallel efficiency. Using a roofline analysis we demonstrate that the overall performance is currently limited by DRAM bandwidth and calculate a performance portability metric of 62.8\%. Finally, we present the implementation strategies used and the challenges encountered in maximizing performance. This will provide other research groups with a straightforward approach to prepare their own codes for the exascale era. K-Athena is available at https://gitlab.com/pgrete/kathena .},

This inverse problem is complicated by noise and boundary effects, and various reconstruction methods have been developed to implement the process. Here we evaluate the retention of signal information of four such methods: Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, {$\mathtt{D}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{r}\mathtt{k}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{y}$}, and {$\mathtt{D}\mathtt{e}\mathtt{e}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{s}\mathtt{s}$}. We use the higher order statistics {$Minkowski$} {$functionals$} to determine which method best reconstructs the original convergence with efficiency and precision. We find {$\mathtt{D}\mathtt{e}\mathtt{e}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{s}\mathtt{s}$} produces the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters, while Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, and {$\mathtt{D}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{r}\mathtt{k}\mathtt{M}\mathtt{a}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{p}\mathtt{y}$} are similar at a smoothing scale of 3.5 arcmin.

  abstract = {Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed ``clumps'' in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed ``clumps'' in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at 0.5{$\leq$}slant z{$<$} 3.0. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties (e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (\{M\}* ), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction) are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U - V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semimajor axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and \{M\}* of the host galaxies: at a fixed \{M\}* , the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with \{M\}* . Based on our SED fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B - V) gradient, and a positive specific SFR gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. Correspondingly, the radial gradients of the derived physical properties of clumps are different from those of the diffuse component or intra-clump regions.},

All the models are built on the same high-resolution \$N\$-body simulations. We find that the HOD model generally provides the best performance in reproducing the clustering measurements in both projected and redshift spaces. The SHAM model with the same halo-galaxy relation for central and satellite galaxies (or distinct haloes and subhaloes), when including scatters, has a best-fitting \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2/{\textbackslash}rm\{dof\}\$ around \$2\$--\$3\$. We therefore extend the SHAM model to the subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) by allowing the central and satellite galaxies to have different galaxy--halo relations. We infer the corresponding halo/subhalo parameters by jointly fitting the galaxy 2PCFs and abundances and consider subhaloes selected based on three properties, the mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm acc\}\$ at the time of accretion, the maximum circular velocity \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm acc\}\$ at the time of accretion, and the peak maximum circular velocity \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}\$ over the history of the subhaloes. The three subhalo models work well for luminous galaxy samples (with luminosity above \$L\_*\$). For low-luminosity samples, the \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm acc\}\$ model stands out in reproducing the data, with the \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm peak\}\$ model slightly worse, while the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm acc\}\$ model fails to fit the data. We discuss the implications of the modeling results.},

We selected a sample of systems based only on the properties of the sources, requiring them to be bright (apparent \$i\$-band magnitude \$ {$<$} 17.4\$) and in the nearby Universe (\$z {$<$} 0.15\$). We have observed the velocity fields of the sources with WiFeS, an optical IFU on a 2.3m telescope, and fitted them using a simple circular motion model with an external shear. We have measured an average shear of \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}rangle = 0.020 {\textbackslash}pm 0.008\$ compared to a predicted \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}gamma\_\{pred\} {\textbackslash}rangle = 0.005\$ obtained using median stellar-to-halo relationships from the literature. While still a statistical approach, our results suggest that this new weak lensing methodology can overcome some of the limitations of traditional stacking-based techniques.

  abstract = {Spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling is one of the main methods to estimate galaxy properties, such as photometric redshifts, \$z\$, and stellar masses, \$M\_*\$, for extragalactic imaging surveys. SEDs are currently modeled as light from a composite stellar population attenuated by a uniform foreground dust screen, despite evidence from simulations and observations that find large spatial variations in dust attenuation due to the detailed geometry of stars and gas within galaxies. In this work, we examine the impact of this simplistic dust assumption on inferred \$z\$ and \$M\_*\$ for Rubin LSST. We first construct synthetic LSST-like observations (\$ugrizy\$ magnitudes) from the NIHAO-SKIRT catalog, which provides SEDs from high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations using 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer. We then infer \$z\$ and \$M\_*\$ from the synthetic observations using the PROVABGS Bayesian SED modeling framework. Overall, the uniform dust screen assumption biases both \$z\$ and \$M\_*\$ in galaxies, consistently and significantly for galaxies with dust attenuation \$A\_V rsim 0.5\$, and likely below. The biases depend on the orientation in which the galaxies are observed. At \$z=0.4\$, \$z\$ is overestimated by \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.02 for face-on galaxies and \$M\_*\$ is underestimated by \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.4 dex for edge-on galaxies. The bias in photo-\$z\$ is equivalent to the desired redshift precision level of LSST "gold sample" and will be larger at higher redshifts. Our results underscore the need for SED models with additional flexibility in the dust parameterization to mitigate significant systematic biases in cosmological analyses with LSST.},

The semi-analytic calculations have been performed in a wide variety of generic models for the redshift distribution of source galaxies and power-law models for the bias parameter between the galaxy and dark matter distributions. The semi-analytic predictions are tested successfully against numerical simulations. We find the relative amplitude of the SLC effect on S3 to be of the order of 5-40 per cent. It depends significantly on the redshift distribution of sources and on the way in which the bias parameter evolves. We discuss possible measurement strategies to minimize the SLC effects.},

Using a lambda cold dark matter N-body simulation, we carry out a comprehensive study of the joint bias dependence on halo structure, formation history, and environment. We show that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls into three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias variation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent mass accretion history. For low-mass and late-forming haloes, bias depends more on the structure of a halo such as its shape and spin. Our framework enables us to convincingly prove that Vmax/Vvir is a lossy proxy of formation time for bias modelling, whereas the mass, spin, shape, and formation time variables are non-redundant with respect to each other. Combining mass and formation time largely accounts for the mass accretion history dependence of bias. Combining all the internal halo properties fully accounts for the density profile dependence inside haloes, and predicts the clustering variation of individual haloes to a 20\{\{ per cent\}\} level at \{{$\sim$} \} 10 Mpc h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. When an environmental density is measured outside 1 Mpc h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} from the halo centre, it outperforms and largely accounts for the bias dependence on the internal halo structure, explaining the bias variation above a level of 30\{\{ per cent\}\}.},

  abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The DES Deep Fields comprise 11 fields (10 DES supernova fields plus COSMOS), with a total area of \${\textbackslash}sim30{\textasciitilde}\$ square degrees in \$ugriz\$ bands and reaching a maximum \$i\$-band depth of 26.75 (AB, \$10{\textbackslash}sigma\$, 2 arcsec). We present a catalogue for the DES 3-year cosmology analysis of those four fields with full 8-band coverage, totalling \$5.88{\textasciitilde}\$ sq. deg. after masking. Numbering \$2.8{\textasciitilde}\$million objects (\$1.6{\textasciitilde}\$million post masking), our catalogue is drawn from images coadded to consistent depths of \$r=25.7, i=25, z=24.3\$ mag. We use a new model-fitting code, built upon established methods, to deblend sources and ensure consistent colours across the \$u\$-band to \$Ks\$-band wavelength range. We further detail the tight control we maintain over the point-spread function modelling required for the model fitting, astrometry and consistency of photometry between the four fields. The catalogue allows us to perform a careful star-galaxy separation and produces excellent photometric redshift performance (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm NMAD\} = 0.023\$ at \$i{$<$}23\$). The Deep-Fields catalogue will be made available as part of the cosmology data products release, following the completion of the DES 3-year weak lensing and galaxy clustering cosmology work.},

At z {$\leq$} 0.5, \$8{\textbackslash}leqslant {\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{M\}\_\{* \}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}) 9\$ galaxies are quenched at d node {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 Mpc, and have significantly suppressed star formation at d fil {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 Mpc, trends driven mostly by satellite galaxies. At z {$\leq$} 1, in contrast to the monotonic drop in of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{M\}\_\{* \}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}) 10\$ galaxies with decreasing d node and d fil, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}(\{M\}\_\{* \}/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}){\textbackslash}geqslant 10\$ galaxies-both centrals and satellites-experience an upturn in at d node {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 Mpc. Much of this cosmic web dependence of star formation activity can be explained by an evolution in gas{$>$}. Our results suggest that in the past {\textasciitilde}10 Gyr, low-mass satellites are quenched by rapid gas stripping in dense environments near nodes and gradual gas starvation in intermediate-density environments near filaments. At earlier times, cosmic web structures efficiently channeled cold gas into most galaxies. State-of-the-art ongoing spectroscopic surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI, as well as those planned with the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph, JWST, and Roman, are required to test our predictions against observations.},

  abstract = {Models of stellar population synthesis (SPS) are the fundamental tool that relates the physical properties of a galaxy to its spectral energy distribution (SED). In this paper, we present DSPS: a python package for stellar population synthesis. All of the functionality in DSPS is implemented natively in the JAX library for automatic differentiation, and so our predictions for galaxy photometry are fully differentiable, and directly inherit the performance benefits of JAX, including portability onto GPUs. DSPS also implements several novel features, such as i) a flexible empirical model for stellar metallicity that incorporates correlations with stellar age, and ii) support for the diffstar model that provides a physically-motivated connection between the star formation history of a galaxy (SFH) and the mass assembly of its underlying dark matter halo. We detail a set of theoretical techniques for using autodiff to calculate gradients of predictions for galaxy SEDs with respect to SPS parameters that control a range of physical effects, including SFH, stellar metallicity, nebular emission, and dust attenuation. When forward modeling the colors of a synthetic galaxy population, we find that DSPS can provide a factor of 5 speedup over standard SPS codes on a CPU, and a factor of 300-400 on a modern GPU. When coupled with gradient-based techniques for optimization and inference, DSPS makes it practical to conduct expansive likelihood analyses of simulation-based models of the galaxy--halo connection that fully forward model galaxy spectra and photometry.},

The package supports many of the common forms used to describe galaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution, the conditional luminosity function, abundance matching, and alternatives to these models that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos or to follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy population---including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, galaxy group identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and others---allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple, interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code notes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an online textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation with Python.},

We characterize the shape and kinematics of these galaxies with a focus on the kinematic misalignment (\${\textbackslash}Psi\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{int\}\$) between the angular momentum (AM) and morphological major axis. We find that the traditional purely shape- or kinematics-based classifications are insufficient to characterize the diversity of our sample and define a new set of classes based on the rates of change of the galaxies' morphological and kinematic axes. We show that these classes are mostly stable over time and correspond to six distinct populations of galaxies: the rapid AM reorienters (58\% of our sample), unsettled galaxies (10\%), spinning disks (10\%), twirling cigars (16\%), misaligned slow reorienters (3\%), and regular prolate rotators (galaxies that display major axis rotation; 2\%). We demonstrate that the most-recent significant (mass-ratio \${\textbackslash}mu{$>$}1/10\$) mergers of these galaxies are the primary cause for their present-day properties and find that these mergers are best characterized at the point of the satellite's final infall -- that is, much closer to the final coalescence than has been previously thought. We show that regular prolate rotators evolve from spinning disk progenitors that experience a radial merger along their internal AM direction. Finally, we argue that these regular prolate rotators are distinct from the similarly-sized population of rapid AM reorienters with large \${\textbackslash}Psi\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{int\}\$, implying that a large \${\textbackslash}Psi\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{int\}\$ is not a sufficient condition for major axis rotation.},

  abstract = {Modern sky surveys are returning precision measurements of cosmological statistics such as weak lensing shear correlations, the distribution of galaxies, and cluster abundance. To fully exploit these observations, theorists must provide predictions that are at least as accurate as the measurements, as well as robust estimates of systematic errors that are inherent to the modeling process. In the nonlinear regime of structure formation, this challenge can only be overcome by developing a large-scale, multi-physics simulation capability covering a range of cosmological models and astrophysical processes. As a first step to achieving this goal, we have recently developed a prediction scheme for the matter power spectrum (a so-called emulator), accurate at the 1\% level out to k {\textasciitilde} 1 Mpc-1 and z = 1 for wCDM cosmologies based on a set of high-accuracy N-body simulations. It is highly desirable to increase the range in both redshift and wavenumber and to extend the reach in cosmological parameter space. To make progress in this direction, while minimizing computational cost, we present a strategy that maximally reuses the original simulations. We demonstrate improvement over the original spatial dynamic range by an order of magnitude, reaching k {\textasciitilde} 10 h Mpc-1, a four-fold increase in redshift coverage, to z = 4, and now include the Hubble parameter as a new independent variable. To further the range in k and z, a new set of nested simulations run at modest cost is added to the original set. The extension in h is performed by including perturbation theory results within a multi-scale procedure for building the emulator. This economical methodology still gives excellent error control, {\textasciitilde}5\% near the edges of the domain of applicability of the emulator. A public domain code for the new emulator is released as part of the work presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {We study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potential resembling that of the Milky Way. Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin for the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10Gyr few obvious asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space, strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple analytic description of these effects, based on a linearized treatment in action-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of the debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that a single dwarf elliptical-like satellite of current luminosity 10{\textasciicircum}8L\_solar disrupted 10Gyr ago from an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre {\textasciitilde}12kpc) would contribute about {\textasciitilde}30 kinematically cold streams with internal velocity dispersions below 5kms{\textasciicircum}-1 to the local stellar halo. If the whole stellar halo were built by such disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of 300-500 such streams. Clear detection of all these structures would require a sample of a few thousand stars with 3D velocities accurate to better than 5kms{\textasciicircum}-1. Even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expected clumpiness should be quite evident. We apply our formalism to a group of stars detected near the North Galactic Pole, and derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.},

In recent years, we have experienced a change in paradigm thanks to the discovery of large amounts of substructure, especially in the outer halo.

  abstract = {We use the BAHAMAS (BAryons and HAloes of MAssive Systems) and MACSIS (MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structures) hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the impact of baryons on the mass distribution and dynamics of massive galaxy clusters, as well as the bias in X-ray and weak lensing mass estimates. These simulations use the subgrid physics models calibrated in the BAHAMAS project, which include feedback from both supernovae and active galactic nuclei. They form a cluster population covering almost two orders of magnitude in mass, with more than 3500 clusters with masses greater than 1014 M{$\odot$} at z = 0. We start by characterizing the clusters in terms of their spin, shape and density profile, before considering the bias in both weak lensing and hydrostatic mass estimates. Whilst including baryonic effects leads to more spherical, centrally concentrated clusters, the median weak lensing mass bias is unaffected by the presence of baryons. In both the dark matter only and hydrodynamic simulations, the weak lensing measurements underestimate cluster masses by {$\approx$}10 per cent for clusters with M200 {$\leq$} 1015 M{$\odot$} and this bias tends to zero at higher masses. We also consider the hydrostatic bias when using both the true density and temperature profiles, and those derived from X-ray spectroscopy. When using spectroscopic temperatures and densities, the hydrostatic bias decreases as a function of mass, leading to a bias of {$\approx$}40 per cent for clusters with M500 {$\geq$} 1015 M{$\odot$}. This is due to the presence of cooler gas in the cluster outskirts. Using mass weighted temperatures and the true density profile reduces this bias to 5-15 per cent.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters have a triaxial matter distribution. The weak-lensing signal, an important part in cosmological studies, measures the projected mass of all matter along the line-of-sight, and therefore changes with the orientation of the cluster. Studies suggest that the shape of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the centre of the cluster traces the underlying halo shape, enabling a method to account for projection effects. We use 324 simulated clusters at four redshifts between 0.1 and 0.6 from `The Three Hundred Project' to quantify correlations between the orientation and shape of the BCG and the halo. We find that haloes and their embedded BCGs are aligned, with an average \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 degree angle between their major axes. The bias in weak lensing cluster mass estimates correlates with the orientation of both the halo and the BCG. Mimicking observations, we compute the projected shape of the BCG, as a measure of the BCG orientation, and find that it is most strongly correlated to the weak-lensing mass for relaxed clusters. We also test a 2-dimensional cluster relaxation proxy measured from BCG mass isocontours. The concentration of stellar mass in the projected BCG core compared to the total stellar mass provides an alternative proxy for the BCG orientation. We find that the concentration does not correlate to the weak-lensing mass bias, but does correlate with the true halo mass. These results indicate that the BCG shape and orientation for large samples of relaxed clusters can provide information to improve weak-lensing mass estimates.},

  abstract = {We present a study on the inference of cosmological and astrophysical parameters using stacked galaxy cluster profiles. Utilizing the CAMELS-zoomGZ simulations, we explore how various cluster properties--such as X-ray surface brightness, gas density, temperature, metallicity, and Compton-y profiles--can be used to predict parameters within the 28-dimensional parameter space of the IllustrisTNG model. Through neural networks, we achieve a high correlation coefficient of 0.97 or above for all cosmological parameters, including \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$, \$H\_0\$, and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, and over 0.90 for the remaining astrophysical parameters, showcasing the effectiveness of these profiles for parameter inference. We investigate the impact of different radial cuts, with bins ranging from \$0.1R\_\{200c\}\$ to \$0.7R\_\{200c\}\$, to simulate current observational constraints. Additionally, we perform a noise sensitivity analysis, adding up to 40{\textbackslash}\% Gaussian noise (corresponding to signal-to-noise ratios as low as 2.5), revealing that key parameters such as \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$, \$H\_0\$, and the IMF slope remain robust even under extreme noise conditions. We also compare the performance of full radial profiles against integrated quantities, finding that profiles generally lead to more accurate parameter inferences. Our results demonstrate that stacked galaxy cluster profiles contain crucial information on both astrophysical processes within groups and clusters and the underlying cosmology of the universe. This underscores their significance for interpreting the complex data expected from next-generation surveys and reveals, for the first time, their potential as a powerful tool for parameter inference.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the GI correlation term can exceed the usual II term by {$>$}1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of order {\textasciitilde}10\% at z\_s=1 and {\textasciitilde}30\% at z\_s=0.5.},

We find that the non-Gaussianity of the point spread function has a significant effect and can lead to an error of up to 15 per cent on the linear amplitude of fluctuations {$\sigma$}8, depending on the method of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method that reduces the error to a calibration error of the order of 1 per cent, even for poorly resolved galaxies. We also discuss a new type of shear selection bias, which results in up to roughly an 8 per cent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift, inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for. Understanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is to become a high-precision probe of cosmology.},

Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (`FIRE-1') for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce `FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central ({$\sim$}kpc) mass concentrations in massive ({$>$}L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

  abstract = {In light of recent findings from the kinematic morphology--density relation, we investigate whether the same trends exist in the original morphology--density relation, using the same data as Dressler. In addition to Dressler's canonical relations, we find that further refinements are possible when considering the average local projected density of galaxies in a cluster. First, the distribution of ellipticals in a cluster depends on the relative local density of galaxies in that cluster: equivalent rises in the elliptical fraction occur at higher local densities for clusters with higher average local densities. This is not true for the late-type fraction, where the variation with local density within a cluster is independent of the average local density of galaxies in that cluster, and is as Dressler originally found. Furthermore, the overall ratio of ellipticals to early types in a cluster does not depend on the average density of galaxies in that cluster (unlike the ratio of lenticulars to disc systems), and is fixed at around 30 per cent. In the paradigm of fast and slow rotators, we show that such an elliptical fraction in the early type population is consistent with a slow rotator fraction of 15 per cent in the early type population, using the statistics of the ATLAS3D survey. We also find the scatter in the overall ratio of ellipticals to early types is greatest for clusters with lower average densities, such that clusters with the highest elliptical fractions have the lowest average local densities. Finally, we show that average local projected density correlates well with global projected density, but the latter has difficulty in accurately characterizing the density of irregular cluster morphologies.},

  abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that massive galaxies form in a two-phased fashion, beginning with a rapid mass buildup through intense starburst activities followed by primarily dry mergers that mainly deposit stellar mass at outskirts, the late time stellar mass growth of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the most massive galaxies in the universe, is still not well understood. Several independent measurements have indicated a slower mass growth rate than predictions from theoretical models. We attempt to resolve the discrepancy by measuring the frequency of BCGs with multiple cores, which serve as a proxy of the merger rates in the central region and facilitate a more direct comparison with theoretical predictions. Using 79 BCGs at z = 0.06-0.15 with integral field spectroscopic data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) project, we obtain a multiple-core fraction of 0.11 {\textpm} 0.04 at z {$\approx$} 0.1 within an 18 kpc radius from the center, which is comparable to the value of 0.08 {\textpm} 0.04 derived from mock observations of 218 simulated BCGs from the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG. We find that most cores that appear close to the BCGs from imaging data turn out to be physically associated systems. Anchoring on the similarity in the multiple-core frequency between the MaNGA and IllustrisTNG, we discuss the mass growth rate of BCGs over the past 4.5 Gyr.},

  abstract = {The Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) is an ambitious multi-band survey using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. The Wide layer of the SSP is both wide and deep, reaching a detection limit of i {$\sim$} 26.0 mag. At these depths, it is challenging to achieve accurate, unbiased, and consistent photometry across all five bands. The HSC data are reduced using a pipeline that builds on the prototype pipeline for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. We have developed a Python-based, flexible framework to inject synthetic galaxies into real HSC images, called SynPipe. Here we explain the design and implementation of SynPipe and generate a sample of synthetic galaxies to examine the photometric performance of the HSC pipeline. For stars, we achieve 1\% photometric precision at i {$\sim$} 19.0 mag and 6\% precision at i {$\sim$} 25.0 in the i band (corresponding to statistical scatters of {$\sim$}0.01 and {$\sim$}0.06 mag respectively). For synthetic galaxies with single-S{\'e}rsic profiles, forced CModel photometry achieves 13\% photometric precision at i {$\sim$} 20.0 mag and 18\% precision at i {$\sim$} 25.0 in the i band (corresponding to statistical scatters of {$\sim$}0.15 and {$\sim$}0.22 mag respectively). We show that both forced point spread function and CModel photometry yield unbiased color estimates that are robust to seeing conditions. We identify several caveats that apply to the version of HSC pipeline used for the first public HSC data release (DR1) that need to be taking into consideration. First, the degree to which an object is blended with other objects impacts the overall photometric performance. This is especially true for point sources. Highly blended objects tend to have larger photometric uncertainties, systematically underestimated fluxes, and slightly biased colors. Secondly, {$>$}20\% of stars at 22.5 {$<$} i {$<$} 25.0 mag can be misclassified as extended objects. Thirdly, the current CModel algorithm tends to strongly underestimate the half-light radius and ellipticity of galaxy with i {$>$} 21.5 mag.},

We use data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey that is simultaneously wide ({$\sim$}100 deg2) and deep ({$>$}28.5 mag arcsec-2 in i band) to study the stellar haloes of a sample of {$\sim$}7000 massive galaxies at z {$\sim$} 0.4. The depth of the HSC data enables us to measure surface mass density profiles to 100 kpc for individual galaxies without stacking. As in previous work, we find that more massive galaxies exhibit more extended outer profiles than smaller galaxies. When this extended light is not properly accounted for (because of shallow imaging and/or inadequate profile modelling), the derived stellar mass function can be significantly underestimated at the high-mass end. Across our sample, the ellipticity of outer light profile increases substantially with radius. We show for the first time that these ellipticity gradients steepen dramatically as a function of galaxy mass, but we detect no mass dependence in outer colour gradients. Our results support the two-phase formation scenario for massive galaxies in which outer envelopes are built up at a later time from a series of merging events. We provide surface mass density profiles in a convenient tabulated format to facilitate comparisons with predictions from numerical simulations of galaxy formation.},

We devise a method (the "TopN" test) to evaluate the scatter in the halo mass-observable relation for different tracers and inter-compare halo mass proxies in four number density bins using stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. This test reveals three key findings. The stellar mass based on cModel photometry or aperture luminosity within R{$<$}30 kpc is a poor proxy of halo mass. In contrast, the stellar mass of the outer envelope is an excellent halo mass proxy. The stellar mass within R=[50,100] kpc, M*[50,100], has performance comparable to the state-of-the-art richness-based cluster finders at \${\textbackslash}log\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}{$>$}14.0\$ and could be a better halo mass tracer at lower halo masses. Finally, using N-body simulations, we find that the lensing profiles of massive halos selected by M*[50,100] are consistent with the expectation for a sample without projection or mis-centering effects. On the other hand, Richness-selected clusters display an excess at R{\textasciitilde}1 Mpc in their lensing profiles, which may suggest a more significant impact from selection biases. These results suggest that Mstar-based tracers have distinct advantages in identifying massive halos, which could open up new avenues for cluster cosmology.},

  abstract = {Using deep images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and taking advantage of its unprecedented weak lensing capabilities, we reveal a remarkably tight connection between the stellar mass distribution of massive central galaxies and their host dark matter halo mass. Massive galaxies with more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark matter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at \$r{$<$}10\$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description of the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm Max\}\$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$) and also reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different stellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear dependence on \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$. Our two-parameter \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm Max\}\$-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ description provides a more accurate picture of the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex-situ component dominates the mass profiles of galaxies at \$r{$<$} 10\$ kpc for \${\textbackslash}log M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}ge 11.7\$).

The recent discovery of the previously predicted acoustic peaks in the power spectrum has established a working cosmological model: a critical density universe consisting of mainly dark matter and dark energy, which formed its structure through gravitational instability from quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch. Future observations should test this model and measure its key cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. The phenomenology and cosmological implications of the acoustic peaks are developed in detail. Beyond the peaks, the yet to be detected secondary anisotropies and polarization present opportunities to study the physics of inflation and the dark energy. The analysis techniques devised to extract cosmological information from voluminous CMB data sets are outlined, given their increasing importance in experimental cosmology as a whole.},

From a detailed morphological analysis we infer that {$\sim$}80 per cent of passive galaxies with mass log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 10.5 have an early-type morphology and that this fraction does not evolve over the last 6 Gyr. However, the relative abundance of lenticular and elliptical galaxies depends on stellar mass. Elliptical galaxies dominate only at the very high mass end - log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 11 - while S0 galaxies dominate at lower stellar masses - 10.5 {$<$} log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 11. The galaxy size growth depends on galaxy mass range and early-type galaxy morphology, e.g. elliptical galaxies evolve differently than lenticular galaxies. At the low-mass end - 10.5 {$<$} log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 11 - ellipticals do not show strong size growth from z {$\sim$} 1 to the present (10 to 30 per cent depending on the morphological classification). On the other end, massive ellipticals - log(M/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 11.2 - approximately doubled their size. Interestingly, lenticular galaxies display different behaviour: they appear more compact on average and they do show a size growth of {$\sim$}60 per cent since z = 1 independent of stellar mass range. We compare our results with state-of-the art semi-analytic models. While major and minor mergers can account for most of the galaxy size growth, we find that with present data and the theoretical uncertainties in the modelling we cannot state clear evidence favouring either merger or mass-loss via quasar and/or stellar winds as the primary mechanism driving the evolution. The galaxy mass-size relation and size growth do not depend on environment in the halo mass range explored in this work (field to group mass log(Mh/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 14), i.e. group and field galaxies follow the same trends. At low redshift, where we examine both Sloan Digital Sky Survey and COSMOS groups, this result is at variance with predictions from some current hierarchical models that show a clear dependence of size growth on halo mass for massive ellipticals (log(M*/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 11.2). In future work, we will analyse in detail if this result is specific of the observations and model used in this work. Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCG) and satellite galaxies lie on the same mass-size relation, at variance with predictions from hierarchical models, which predict that BCGs should have larger sizes than satellites because they experience more mergers in groups over the halo mass range probed.},

In this work, we first present a new method based on neural networks to detect clumps in galaxy images. We use this method to detect clumps in the rest-frame optical and UV images of a complete sample of {\textasciitilde}1500 star forming galaxies at 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3 in the CANDELS survey as well as in images from the VELA zoom-in cosmological simulations. We show that observational effects have a dramatic impact on the derived clump properties leading to an overestimation of the clump mass up to a factor of 10, which highlights the importance of fair comparisons between observations and simulations and the limitations of current HST data to study the resolved structure of distant galaxies. After correcting for these effects with a mixture density network, we estimate that the clump stellar mass function follows a power law down to the completeness limit (107 solar masses) with the majority of the clumps being less massive than 109 solar masses. This is in better agreement with recent gravitational lensing based measurements. The simulations explored in this work overall reproduce the shape of the observed clump stellar mass function and clumpy fractions when confronted under the same conditions, although they tend to lie in the lower limit of the confidence intervals of the observations. This agreement suggests that most of the observed clumps are formed in situ.},

Our technique infers multiplicative shear calibration parameters by modifying the actual survey data to simulate the effects of a known shear. It can be applied to any shear estimation method based on weighted averages of galaxy shape measurements, which includes all methods used to date for shear estimation with real data. Use of the real images mitigates uncertainty due to unknown galaxy morphology, which is a serious concern for calibration of shear estimates based on image simulations. We test our results on simulated images from the GREAT3 challenge, and show that the method eliminates calibration biases for several different shape measurement techniques at the level of precision measurable with the GREAT3 simulations (a few tenths of a percent).},

  abstract = {We present a general statistical framework for describing the effect of sample variance in the number counts of virialized objects and examine its effect on cosmological parameter estimation. Specifically, we consider effects of sample variance on the power spectrum normalization and properties of dark energy extracted from current and future local and high-redshift samples of clusters. We show that for future surveys that probe ever lower cluster masses and temperatures, sample variance is generally comparable to or greater than shot noise and thus cannot be neglected in deriving precision cosmological constraints. For example, sample variance is usually more important than shot variance in constraints on the equation of state of the dark energy from z{$<$}1 clusters. Although we found that effects of sample variance on the {$\sigma$}8-{\textohm}m constraints from the current flux- and temperature-limited X-ray surveys are not significant, they may be important for future studies utilizing the shape of the temperature function to break the {$\sigma$}8-{\textohm}m degeneracy. We also present numerical tests clarifying the definition of cluster mass employed in cosmological modeling and an accurate fitting formula for the conversion between different definitions of halo mass (e.g., virial vs. fixed overdensity).},

  abstract = {The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years, and further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects. These will enable us to map the evolution of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to several pieces of fundamental physics: the primordial perturbations generated by GUT-scale physics; neutrino masses and interactions; the nature of dark matter and dark energy. We focus on the last of these here: the ways that combining probes of growth with those of the cosmic expansion such as distance-redshift relations will pin down the mechanism driving the acceleration of the Universe. One way to explain the acceleration of the Universe is invoke dark energy parameterized by an equation of state w. Distance measurements provide one set of constraints on w, but dark energy also affects how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of structure. Upcoming surveys are therefore designed to probe w with direct observations of the distance scale and the growth of structure, each complementing the other on systematic errors and constraints on dark energy. A consistent set of results will greatly increase the reliability of the final answer. Another possibility is that there is no dark energy, but that General Relativity does not describe the laws of physics accurately on large scales. While the properties of gravity have been measured with exquisite precision at stellar system scales and densities, within our solar system and by binary pulsar systems, its properties in different environments are poorly constrained. To fully understand if General Relativity is the complete theory of gravity we must test gravity across a spectrum of scales and densities. Rapid developments in gravitational wave astronomy and numerical relativity are directed at testing gravity in the high curvature, high density regime. Cosmological evolution provides a polar opposite test bed, probing how gravity behaves in the lowest curvature, low density environments. There are a number of different implementations of astrophysically relevant modifications of gravity. Generically, the models are able to reproduce the distance measurements while at the same time altering the growth of structure. In particular, as detailed below, the Poisson equation relating over-densities to gravitational potentials is altered, and the potential that determines the geodesics of relativistic particles (such as photons) differs from the potential that determines the motion of non-relativistic particles. Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES, eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1\% in the redshift range 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 2 , over the last 3/4 of the age of the Universe.},

In this first contribution, we present the u-band component of the survey, describe the observational strategy, and discuss some first highlight results, based on approximately one-third of the final area. We show that the Galactic anticenter structure is distributed continuously along the line of sight, out to beyond 20 kpc, and possesses a metallicity distribution that is essentially identical to that of the outer disk sampled by APOGEE. This suggests that it is probably a buckled disk of old metal-rich stars, rather than a stream or a flare. We also discuss the future potential for CFIS-u in discovering star-forming dwarf galaxies around the Local Group, the characterization of the white dwarf and blue straggler population of the Milky Way, as well as its sensitivity to low surface brightness structures in external galaxies.},

We split the cluster sample into 14 redshift-richness bins and derive the halo bias and the virial mass in each bin by means of a stacked weak lensing analysis. The observed halo bias-mass relation and the theoretical predictions based on the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM standard cosmological model show an agreement within \$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$.

From an analysis of the evolution of the power spectra, we conclude that our simulations remain accurate from the baryon acoustic oscillation scale down to the very small. We also provide parameters of a mass-concentration model, which describes the evolution of halo concentration and reproduces our simulation data to within 5 per cent for haloes with masses spanning nearly eight orders of magnitude at redshift 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 14.

  abstract = {Galaxies exhibit coherent alignments with local structure in the Universe. This effect, called Intrinsic Alignments (IA), is an important contributor to the systematic uncertainties for wide-field weak lensing surveys. On cosmological distance scales, intrinsic shape alignments have been observed in red galaxies, which are usually bulge-dominated; while blue galaxies, which are mostly disc-dominated, exhibit shape alignments consistent with a null detection. However, disc-dominated galaxies typically consist of two prominent structures: disc and bulge. Since the bulge component has similar properties as elliptical galaxies and is thought to have formed in a similar fashion, naturally one could ask whether the bulge components exhibit similar alignments as ellipticals? In this paper, we investigate how different components of galaxies exhibit IA in the TNG100-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, as well as the dependence of IA on the fraction of stars in rotation-dominated structures at \$z=0\$. The measurements were controlled for mass differences between the samples. We find that the bulges exhibit significantly higher IA signals, with a nonlinear alignment model amplitude of \$A\_I = 2.98{\textasciicircum}\{+0.36\}\_\{-0.37\}\$ compared to the amplitude for the galaxies as a whole (both components), \$A\_I = 1.13{\textasciicircum}\{+0.37\}\_\{-0.35\}\$. The results for bulges are statistically consistent with those for elliptical galaxies, which have \$A\_I = 3.47{\textasciicircum}\{+0.57\}\_\{-0.57\}\$. These results highlight the importance of studying galaxy dynamics in order to understand galaxy alignments and their cosmological implications.},

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra. This Second Edition features new chapters on deep learning, survival analysis, and multiple testing, as well as expanded treatments of na{\"i}ve Bayes, generalized linear models, Bayesian additive regression trees, and matrix completion.

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) emerges as an alternative framework of likelihood-free inference methods. It identifies a quasi-posterior distribution by finding values of parameter that simulate the synthetic data resembling the observed data. A major ingredient of ABC is the discrepancy measure between the observed and the simulated data, which conventionally involves a fundamental difficulty of constructing effective summary statistics. To bypass this difficulty, we adopt a Kullback-Leibler divergence estimator to assess the data discrepancy. Our method enjoys the asymptotic consistency and linearithmic time complexity as the data size increases. In experiments on five benchmark models, this method achieves a comparable or higher quasi-posterior quality, compared to the existing methods using other discrepancy measures.},

  abstract = {We study ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in zoom in cosmological simulations, seeking the origin of UDGs in the field versus galaxy groups. We find that while field UDGs arise from dwarfs in a characteristic mass range by multiple episodes of supernova feedback (Di Cintio et~al.), group UDGs may also form by tidal puffing up and they become quiescent by ram-pressure stripping. The field and group UDGs share similar properties, independent of distance from the group centre. Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and centrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a prolate shape with a S{\'e}rsic index n {$\sim$} 1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure removes the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star formation in them and making them redder. This generates a colour/star-formation-rate gradient with distance from the centre of the dense environment, as observed in clusters. We find that {$\sim$}20~per\,cent of the field UDGs that fall into a massive halo survive as satellite UDGs. In addition, normal field dwarfs on highly eccentric orbits can become UDGs near pericentre due to tidal puffing up, contributing about half of the group-UDG population. We interpret our findings using simple toy models, showing that gas stripping is mostly due to ram pressure rather than tides. We estimate that the energy deposited by tides in the bound component of a satellite over one orbit can cause significant puffing up provided that the orbit is sufficiently eccentric. We caution that while the simulations produce UDGs that match the observations, they under-produce the more compact dwarfs in the same mass range, possibly because of the high threshold for star formation or the strong feedback.},

  abstract = {We present a study of unprecedented statistical power regarding the halo-to-halo variance of dark matter substructure. Combining N-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in subhalo mass fractions and occupation numbers, with an emphasis on their halo-formation-time dependence. We show that the average subhalo mass fraction, fsub, is mainly a function of halo formation time: at fixed formation redshift, the average subhalo mass fraction is virtually independent of halo mass and the mass dependence of fsub therefore mainly manifests the later assembly of more massive haloes. We note that the observational constraints on fsub from gravitational lensing are substantially higher than the median {$\Lambda$}cold dark matter predictions, yet marginally lie within the 95th percentile when the halo-to-halo variance is considered. The halo occupation number distribution of subhaloes, P(Nsub{\textbar}Mhalo), in addition to the well-known super-Poissonity for large {\textlangle}Nsub{\textrangle}, is sub-Poissonian for {\textlangle}Nsub{\textrangle} {$\lessequivlnt$} 2. Ignoring this results in systematic errors of the predicted clustering of galaxies of a few percent, with a complicated scale- and luminosity dependence. The non-Poissonity is likely imprinted at accretion, and the dynamical evolution of subhaloes drives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the non-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting haloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo occupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation redshift of the Milky Way halo.},

The density profiles of those simulated halos are well approximated by a sequence of the concentric triaxial distribution with their axis directions being fairly aligned. We characterize the triaxial model quantitatively by generalizing the universal density profile, that has previously been discussed only in the framework of the spherical model. We obtain a series of practically useful fitting formulae in applying the triaxial model: the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio, the mean of the concentration parameter, and the probability distribution functions of the axis ratio and the concentration parameter. These accurate fitting formulae form a complete description of the triaxial density profiles of halos in cold dark matter models. Our current description of the dark halos will be particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects, to a reasonably reliable degree, including the weak and strong lens statistics, the orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos, and the nonlinear clustering of dark matter. In addition, this provides a useful framework for the nonspherical modeling of the intracluster gas, which is crucial in discussing the gas and temperature profiles of X-ray clusters and the Hubble constant estimated via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.},

One model is the SCDM model, and the others are six low-density models with the density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega=0.1\$, 0.2 or 0.3 and with or without a cosmological constant \${\textbackslash}Lambda=1-{\textbackslash}Omega\$. We find that the velocity dispersion profiles depend both on \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ and on \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$. For \${\textbackslash}Lambda=0\$, the profiles are steeper in a lower-\${\textbackslash}Omega\$ model than in a higher-\${\textbackslash}Omega\$ one. The cosmological constant significantly weakens the dependence on \${\textbackslash}Omega\$: the difference in the profile distributions between two flat models is much smaller than that between the two corresponding open models with the same \${\textbackslash}Omega\$. These results in principle can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters when a large sample of the velocity dispersion profiles is available. Motivated by the practical situation that a sample of \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ clusters with \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ measured redshifts per cluster is still the best sample available in the foreseen future, we examine carefully to what degree the cosmological parameters can be constrained with the velocity dispersion profiles of such a sample of clusters. The limited sampling around clusters and the limited number of clusters seriously degrade the discriminative power of the velocity dispersion profiles among cosmological models. We find that the five models of \${\textbackslash}Omega{\textbackslash}ge 0.2\$ cannot be distinguished by this type of observation. Due to the limited sampling, one should be very cautious in extracting information about the density profile and/or the dynamics around single clusters from the diluted velocity dispersion profiles},

  abstract = {This dissertation studies the effects of dust in N-body simulations of interacting galaxies. A new Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code, Sunrise, is used in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations. Results from radiative-transfer calculations in over 20 SPH simulations of disk-galaxy major mergers (Cox, 2004) are presented. Dust has a profound effect on the appearance of these simulations. At peak luminosities, 90\% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. The dust obscuration increases with luminosity in such a way that the brightness at UV/visual wavelengths remains roughly constant. A general relationship between the fraction of energy absorbed and the ratio of bolometric luminosity to baryonic mass is found to hold in galaxies with metallicities {$>$}0.7 [special characters omitted] over a factor of 50 in mass. The accuracy to which the simulations describe observed starburst galaxies is evaluated by comparing them to observations by Meurer et al. (1999) and Heckman et al. (1998). The simulations are found to follow a relation similar to the IRX-{$\beta$} relation found by Meurer et al. (1999) when similar luminosity objects are considered. The highest-luminosity simulated galaxies depart from this relation and occupy the region where local LIRGs/ULIRGs are found. Comparing to the Heckman et al. (1998) sample, the simulations are found to obey the same relations between UV luminosity, UV color, IR luminosity, absolute blue magnitude and metallicity as the observations. This agreement is contingent on the presence of a realistic mass-metallicity relation, and Milky-Way-like dust. SMC-like dust results in far too red a UV continuum slope. On the whole, the agreement between the simulated and observed galaxies is impressive considering that the simulations have not been fit to agree with the observations, and we conclude that the simulations provide a realistic replication of the real universe. The simulations are used to study the performance of star-formation indicators in the presence of dust. The far-infrared luminosity is found to be reliable. In contrast, the H{$\alpha$} and far-ultraviolet luminosities suffer severely from dust attenuation, and dust corrections can only partially remedy the situation.},

  abstract = {A new Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, SUNRISE, is used in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effects of dust in such systems. Dust has a profound effect on the emerging radiation, consistent with observations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies. The dust attenuation increases with luminosity such that at peak luminosities {\textasciitilde}90\% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. We find that our predictions agree with observed relationships between the UV spectral slope and the fraction of light absorbed by dust (IRX-{$\beta$}) and observational estimates of the optical depth as a function of intrinsic B-band or UV luminosity. In general, the detailed appearance of the merging event depends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. The fraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robust quantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometric luminosity, baryonic mass, star formation rate, and metallicity of the simulated system. This paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses and metallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequently also the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. The attenuation of the luminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a larger scatter due to the variation with viewing angle. These formulae for dust attenuation are consistent with earlier studies and would be suitable for inclusion in theoretical models, e.g., semianalytic models, of galaxy formation and evolution.},

The method relies upon having a small (\${\textbackslash}sim\$10 per cent) reference sample of high-quality redshifts. Within pencil-beam-like sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy, we use the precise dN/d\$z\$ distribution of the reference sample to recover new redshifts and assign them one-to-one to galaxies such that the original rank order of redshifts is preserved. Preserving the rank order is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions with different means but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering. The process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in the survey. This results in every galaxy with an uncertain redshift being assigned multiple "recovered" redshifts from which a new redshift estimate can be determined.

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the disparity between the value of the cosmic expansion rate determined directly from measurements of distance and redshift and that determined instead from the standard Lambda cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model, calibrated by measurements from the early Universe, has grown to a level of significance requiring a solution. Proposed systematic errors are not supported by the breadth of available data (and unknown errors are untestable by lack of definition). Simple theoretical explanations for this Hubble tension that are consistent with the majority of the data have been surprisingly hard to come by, but in recent years, attention has focused increasingly on models that alter the early or pre-recombination physics of {$\Lambda$}CDM as the most feasible. Here, we describe the nature of this tension and emphasize recent developments on the observational side. We then explain why early-Universe solutions are currently favored and the constraints that any such model must satisfy. We discuss one workable example, early dark energy, and describe how it can be tested with future measurements. Given an assortment of more extended recent reviews on specific aspects of the problem, the discussion is intended to be fairly general and understandable to a broad audience.},

  abstract = {Weak lensing by large-scale mass inhomogeneities in the Universe induces correlations in the observed ellipticities of distant sources. We first review the harmonic analysis and statistics required of these correlations and discuss calculations for the predicted signal. We consider the ellipticity correlation function, the mean-square ellipticity, the ellipticity power spectrum and a global maximum-likelihood analysis to isolate a weak-lensing signal from the data. Estimates for the sensitivity of a survey of a given area, surface density, and mean intrinsic source ellipticity are presented. We then apply our results to the FIRST radio-source survey. We predict an rms ellipticity of roughly 0.011 in 1x1 deg{\textasciicircum}2 pixels and 0.018 in 20x20 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2 pixels if the power spectrum is normalized to sigma\_8Omega{\textasciicircum}0.53=0.6, as indicated by the cluster abundance. The signal is significantly larger in some models if the power spectrum is normalized instead to the COBE anisotropy. The uncertainty in the predictions from imprecise knowledge of the FIRST redshift distribution is about 25 per cent in the rms ellipticity. We show that FIRST should be able to make a statistically significant detection of a weak-lensing signal for cluster-abundance-normalized power spectra.},

  abstract = {New and forthcoming deep-wide surveys, from instruments like the HSC, LSST and EUCLID, are poised to revolutionize our understanding of galaxy evolution, by revealing aspects of galaxies that are largely invisible in past wide-area datasets. These surveys will open up the realm of low-surface-brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies -- which dominate the galaxy number density -- for the first time at cosmological distances. They will also reveal key, unexplored LSB structures which strongly constrain our structure-formation paradigm, such as merger-induced tidal features and intra-cluster light. However, exploitation of these revolutionary new datasets will require us to address several data-analysis challenges. Data-processing pipelines will have to preserve LSB structures, which are susceptible to sky over-subtraction. Analysis of the prodigious data volumes will require machine-learning (in particular unsupervised techniques), to augment or even replace traditional methods. Cosmological simulations, which are essential for a statistical understanding of the physics of galaxy evolution, will require mass and spatial resolutions that are high enough to resolve LSB/dwarf galaxies and LSB structures. And finally, estimation of physical properties (e.g. stellar masses and star formation rates) will require reliable redshift information. Since it is unlikely that even next-generation spectrographs will provide complete spectral coverage in the LSB/dwarf regime outside the nearby Universe, photometric redshifts may drive the science from these datasets. It is necessary, therefore, that the accuracy of these redshifts is good enough (e.g. \&lt; 10 per cent) to enable statistical studies in the LSB/dwarf regime. I outline the tremendous discovery potential of new/forthcoming deep-wide surveys and describe techniques which will enable us to solve the data-analysis challenges outlined above. (Abridged)},

  abstract = {The structural evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models is investigated combining ``low-resolution'' satellites from cosmological N-body simulations of parent halos with N=107 particles with high-resolution individual subhalos orbiting within a static host potential. We show that, as a result of mass loss, convergence in the central density profiles requires the initial satellites to be resolved with N=107 particles and parsec-scale force resolution. We find that the density profiles of substructure halos can be well fitted with a power-law central slope that is unmodified by tidal forces even after the tidal stripping of over 99\% of the initial mass and an exponential cutoff in the outer parts. The solution to the missing-satellites problem advocated by Stoehr et al. in 2002 relied on the flattening of the dark matter halo central density cusps by gravitational tides, enabling the observed satellites to be embedded within dark halos with maximum circular velocities as large as 60 km s-1. In contrast, our results suggest that tidal interactions do not provide the mechanism for associating the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way with the most massive substructure halos expected in a CDM universe. Motivated by the structure of our stripped satellites, we compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles of Fornax and Draco to observations, assuming that they are embedded in CDM halos. We demonstrate that models with isotropic and tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions for the stellar component fit the data only if the surrounding dark matter halos have maximum circular velocities in the range 20-35 km s-1. If the dSphs are embedded within halos this large, then the overabundance of satellites within the concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model is significantly alleviated, but this still does not provide the entire solution.},

  abstract = {We analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (DM) halos using high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters and galaxies in the LCDM cosmology. We find that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed in adiabatic simulations. Gas cooling results in an average increase of the principle axis ratios of halos by {\textasciitilde} 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. The systematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to the virial radius. We argue that the differences in simulations with and without cooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools and condenses toward the center, and during major mergers. We perform a series of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in major mergers of DM halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. In the DM halo-only mergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentum of the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. However, significant shape changes in the DM distribution may result if stellar disks are included. In this case the shape of the DM halos is correlated with the morphology of the stellar remnants.},

We analyse two mass-selected samples, one defined using photometric redshifts (10.2~{$\leq~$}log\,M*/M{$\odot~\leq~$}12.0), and a smaller more robust subsample using spectroscopic redshifts (10.6~{$\leq~$}log\,M*/M{$\odot~\leq~$}11.8). We find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and field galaxies of a given morphology. Similarly, we find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and field galaxies of similar rest-frame B~-~V colours. We rule out average size differences larger than 10--20\,per\,cent in both cases. Consistent conclusions are found with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. These results have important consequences for the physical process(es) responsible for the size evolution of galaxies, and in particular the effect of the environment. The remarkable growth in galaxy size observed from z~{$\sim~$}2.5 has been reported to depend on the environment at higher redshifts (z~\&gt;~1), with early-type/passive galaxies in higher density environments growing earlier. Such dependence disappears at lower redshifts. Therefore, if the reported difference at higher-z is real, the growth of field galaxies has caught up with that of cluster galaxies by z~{$\sim~$}1. Any putative mechanism responsible for galaxy growth has to account for the existence of environmental differences at high redshift and their absence (or weakening) at lower redshifts.},

  abstract = {A recent comparison by Merritt of simulated and observed Milky Way-mass galaxies has identified a significant tension between the outskirts (r {$>$} 20 kpc) of the stellar halos in simulated and observed galaxies. Using observations from the Dragonfly telescope and simulated galaxies from the Illustris-TNG100 project, Merritt found that the outskirts of stellar halos in simulated galaxies have surface densities 1-2 dex higher than those of observed galaxies. In this paper, we compare two suites of 15 simulated Milky Way-like galaxies, each drawn from the same initial conditions, simulated with the same hydrodynamical code, but with two different models for feedback from supernovae. We find that the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (MUGS), which use an older "delayed-cooling" model for feedback, also produce too much stellar mass in the outskirts of the halo, with median surface densities well above observational constraints. The MUGS2 simulations, which instead use a new, physically motivated "superbubble" model for stellar feedback, have 1-2 dex lower outer stellar halo masses and surface densities. The MUGS2 simulations generally match both the median surface density profile as well as the scatter in stellar halo surface density profiles seen in observed stellar halos. We conclude that there is no "missing outskirts" problem in cosmological simulations, provided that supernova feedback is modeled in a way that allows it to efficiently regulate star formation in the low-mass progenitor environments of stellar halo outskirts.},

They conduct the fitting by minimizing the algebraic distance in subject to suitable quadratic constraints. The hyperellipsoid-specific (HES) method is an elaboration of existing ellipse and 3D ellipsoid-specific fitting methods. It is shown that HES is ellipsoid-specific in n-dimensional space. A limitation of HES is that it may provide biased fitting results with data originating from an ellipsoid with a large ratio between the longest and shortest main axis. The sum-of-discriminants (SOD) method does not have such a limitation. The constraint used by SOD rejects a subset of non-ellipsoidal quadrics, which enables a high tendency to produce ellipsoidal solutions. Moreover, a regularization technique is presented to force the solutions towards ellipsoids with SOD. The regularization technique is compatible also with several existing 2D and 3D fitting methods. The new methods are compared through extensive numerical experiments with n-dimensional variants of three commonly used direct fitting approaches for quadratic surfaces. The results of the experiments imply that in addition to the superior capability to create ellipsoidal solutions, the estimation accuracy of the new methods is better or equal to that of the reference approaches.},

  abstract = {The Hubble constant (\$H\_0\$), a crucial parameter in cosmology, quantifies the expansion rate of the universe so its precise measurement is important to understand the fundamental dynamics of our evolving universe. One of the major limitations of measuring \$H\_0\$ using time-delay cosmography is the presence of the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in the lens mass modelling. We propose and quantitatively assess the use of galaxy-galaxy shear measurements to break the MSD in the strong lensing mass modelling. We use stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles and corresponding covariance matrices from Huang et al. to constrain the MSD in lens mass modelling with a highly flexible mass profile. Our analyses show that if ideally all galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey can be used to constrain the MSD, we can achieve \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ precision on the MSD constraint. We forecast that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)-like surveys can in general constrain the MSD with \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ per{\textbackslash},cent\}-3{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ precision. Furthermore, if we push weak lensing measurements to a lower angular scale of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.04{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\$, a survey like LSST can provide \${\textbackslash}sim 1{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ precision on the MSD constraint, enabling a measurement of \$H\_0\$ at the 1 per cent level. We demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy weak lensing can robustly constrain the MSD independent of stellar kinematics of the deflector, with wide-field survey data alone.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

  abstract = {We compute the spherical-sky weak-lensing power spectrum of the shear and convergence. We discuss various approximations, such as flat-sky, and first- and second-order Limber equations for the projection. We find that the impact of adopting these approximations is negligible when constraining cosmological parameters from current weak-lensing surveys. This is demonstrated using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey. We find that the reported tension with Planck cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy results cannot be alleviated. For future large-scale surveys with unprecedented precision, we show that the spherical second-order Limber approximation will provide sufficient accuracy. In this case, the cosmic-shear power spectrum is shown to be in agreement with the full projection at the sub-percent level for {$\ell$} {$>$} 3, with the corresponding errors an order of magnitude below cosmic variance for all {$\ell$}. When computing the two-point shear correlation function, we show that the flat-sky fast Hankel transformation results in errors below two percent compared to the full spherical transformation. In the spirit of reproducible research, our numerical implementation of all approximations and the full projection are publicly available within the package NICAEA at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/nicaea.},

  abstract = {Galaxy shapes are not randomly oriented, rather they are statistically aligned in a way that can depend on formation environment, history and galaxy type. Studying the alignment of galaxies can therefore deliver important information about the physics of galaxy formation and evolution as well as the growth of structure in the Universe. In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of intrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical mitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic alignments.},

  abstract = {We present an extension to a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) selected cluster catalog based on observations from the South Pole Telescope (SPT); this catalog extends to lower signal-to-noise than the previous SPT-SZ catalog and therefore includes lower mass clusters. Optically derived redshifts, centers, richnesses and morphological parameters together with catalog contamination and completeness statistics are extracted using the multi-component matched filter algorithm (MCMF) applied to the S/N{$>$}4 SPT-SZ candidate list and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) photometric galaxy catalog. The main catalog contains 811 sources above S/N=4, has 91\% purity and is 95\% complete with respect to the original SZE selection. It contains 50\% more total clusters and twice as many clusters above z=0.8 in comparison to the original SPT-SZ sample. The MCMF algorithm allows us to define subsamples of the desired purity with traceable impact on catalog completeness. As an example, we provide two subsamples with S/N{$>$}4.25 and S/N{$>$}4.5 for which the sample contamination and cleaning-induced incompleteness are both as low as the expected Poisson noise for samples of their size. The subsample with S/N{$>$}4.5 has 98\% purity and 96\% completeness, and will be included in a combined SPT cluster and DES weak-lensing cosmological analysis. We measure the number of false detections in the SPT-SZ candidate list as function of S/N, finding that it follows that expected from assuming Gaussian noise, but with a lower amplitude compared to previous estimates from simulations.},

  abstract = {The first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) provides the largest intracluster medium-selected galaxy cluster and group catalog covering the western Galactic hemisphere. Compared to samples selected purely on X-ray extent, the sample purity can be enhanced by identifying cluster candidates using optical and near-infrared data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Using the red-sequence-based cluster finder eROMaPPer, we measured individual photometric properties (redshift z{$\lambda$}, richness {$\lambda$}, optical center, and BCG position) for 12000 eRASS1 clusters over a sky area of 13 116 deg2, augmented by 247 cases identified by matching the candidates with known clusters from the literature. The median redshift of the identified eRASS1 sample is z = 0.31, with 10\% of the clusters at z {$>$} 0.72. The photometric redshifts have an accuracy of {$\delta$}z/(1 + z) {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.005 for 0.05 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.9. Spectroscopic cluster properties (redshift zspec and velocity dispersion {$\sigma$}) were measured a posteriori for a subsample of 3210 and 1499 eRASS1 clusters, respectively, using an extensive compilation of spectroscopic redshifts of galaxies from the literature. We infer that the primary eRASS1 sample has a purity of 86\% and optical completeness {$>$}95\% for z {$>$} 0.05. For these and further quality assessments of the eRASS1 identified catalog, we applied our identification method to a collection of galaxy cluster catalogs in the literature, as well as blindly on the full Legacy Surveys covering 24069 deg2. Using a combination of these cluster samples, we investigated the velocity dispersion-richness relation, finding that it scales with richness as log({$\lambda$}norm) = 2.401 {\texttimes} log({$\sigma$}) - 5.074 with an intrinsic scatter of {$\delta$}in = 0.10 {\textpm} 0.01 dex. The primary product of our work is the identified eRASS1 cluster catalog with high purity and a well-defined X-ray selection process, opening the path for precise cosmological analyses presented in companion papers.

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are the most recently assembled, massive, bound structures in the Universe. As predicted by General Relativity, given their masses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. Clusters act as some of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe. Light rays traversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and the resulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted and magnified. Lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with unique observational signatures. The strong lensing regime is characterized by effects readily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple-images, and arclets. The weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in the shapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. Cluster lenses have been exploited successfully to address several important current questions in cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es) - understanding cluster mass distributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as well as constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects - probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population - which is statistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thus enabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to the Dark Ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the Universe - as the strength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances between the lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value of cosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe Dark Energy. In this review, we present the basics of cluster lensing and provide a current status report of the field.},

  abstract = {This work presents the application of a new tool, Obiwan, which uses image simulations to determine the selection function of a galaxy redshift survey and calculate three-dimensional (3D) clustering statistics. Obiwan relies on a forward model of the process by which images of the night sky are transformed into a 3D large-scale structure catalogue, and offers several advantages over more traditional map-based techniques - such as operating on individual exposures and adopting a maximum likelihood approach. The photometric pipeline automatically detects and models galaxies and then generates a catalogue of such galaxies with detailed information for each one of them, including their location, redshift, and so on. Systematic biases in the imaging data are therefore imparted into the catalogues and must be accounted for in any scientific analysis of their information content. Obiwan simulates this process for samples selected from the Legacy Surveys imaging data. This imaging data will be used to select target samples for the next-generation Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) experiment. Here, we apply Obiwan to a portion of the SDSS-IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey emission-line galaxies (ELGs). Systematic biases in the data are clearly identified and removed. We compare the 3D clustering results to those obtained by the map-based approach applied to the complete eBOSS Data Release 16 (DR16) sample. We find the results are consistent, thereby validating the eBOSS DR16 ELG catalogues, which is used to obtain cosmological results.},

CosmoDC2 is the starting point for the second data challenge (DC2) carried out by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)3 box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440 deg2 of sky area to a redshift of z = 3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband filter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efficient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSST DESC DC2 analyses. This paper also represents the official release of the cosmoDC2 data set, including an efficient reader that facilitates interaction with the data.},

  abstract = {This paper details the modeling pipeline and validates the baseline analysis choices of the DES Year 3 joint analysis of galaxy clustering and weak lensing (a so-called "3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt" analysis). These analysis choices include the specific combination of cosmological probes, priors on cosmological and systematics parameters, model parameterizations for systematic effects and related approximations, and angular scales where the model assumptions are validated. We run a large number of simulated likelihood analyses using synthetic data vectors to test the robustness of our baseline analysis. We demonstrate that the DES Year 3 modeling pipeline, including the calibrated scale cuts, is sufficiently accurate relative to the constraining power of the DES Year 3 analyses. Our systematics mitigation strategy accounts for astrophysical systematics, such as galaxy bias, intrinsic alignments, source and lens magnification, baryonic effects, and source clustering, as well as for uncertainties in modeling the matter power spectrum, reduced shear, and estimator effects. We further demonstrate excellent agreement between two independently-developed modeling pipelines, and thus rule out any residual uncertainties due to the numerical implementation.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies is one of the major astrophysical systematics for ongoing and future weak lensing surveys. This paper presents the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for current and future surveys (DES, Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) using simulated likelihood analyses and realistic covariances that include higher-order moments of the density field in the computation. We consider a range of possible IA scenarios and test mitigation schemes, which parameterize IA by the fraction of red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA signal (for a subset we consider joint IA and photo-z uncertainties). Compared to previous studies we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models if IA is ignored in the analysis; the amplitude and significance of these biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical uncertainties), luminosity function, and IA scenario: Due to its small statistical errors and relatively shallow observing strategy Euclid is significantly impacted by IA. LSST and WFIRST benefit from their increased survey depth, while the larger statistical errors for DES decrease IA's relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme removes parameter biases due to IA for DES, LSST, and WFIRST even if the shape of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies we recommend the exclusion of red (IA contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear analyses. We find that even a reduction of 20\% in the number density of galaxies only leads to a 4-10\% loss in cosmological constraining power.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, M, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for M{$<$}{\textasciitilde}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law s{$>$}{\textasciitilde}M{$\beta$} with {$\beta$}{\textasciitilde}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to {\textasciitilde}100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z{$>$}{\textasciitilde}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

We use mock Chandra images constructed for a sample of clusters simulated with the Eulerian N-body+gasdynamics adaptive mesh refinement ART code in the concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. The simulations achieve high spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star formation, and other processes accompanying galaxy formation. Our analysis shows that simulated clusters exhibit a high degree of regularity and tight correlations between the considered observables and total mass. The normalizations of the M500-TX, Mg,500-TX, and M500-YX relations agree to better than {\textasciitilde}10\%-15\% with the current observational measurements of these relations. Our results show that YX is the best mass proxy with a remarkably low scatter of only {\textasciitilde}5\%-7\% in M500 for a fixed YX, at both low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters are relaxed or not. In addition, we show that redshift evolution of the YX-M500 relation is close to the self-similar prediction, which makes YX a very attractive mass indicator for measurements of the cluster mass function from X-ray-selected samples.},

  abstract = {The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, \$S\_8\$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$, defined as the total stellar mass within a \$[50,100]\$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ with halo mass. Our results show \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ has a scatter consistent with \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-selected samples introduce features into the measured \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}Sigma\$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the \${\textbackslash}lambda-M\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{out\}\}\$ scaling relation to be \$0.49 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02\$ and \$0.38 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$.},

It has been shown that the lensing amplitude of galaxies in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is lower than expected given their clustering properties. We present new measurements and modelling of galaxies in the BOSS LOWZ sample. We focus on the radial and stellar mass dependence of the lensing amplitude mismatch. We find an amplitude mismatch of around \$35\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ when assuming {$\Lambda$}CDM with Planck Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) constraints. This offset is independent of halo mass and radial scale in the range Mhalo {\textasciitilde} 1013.3-1013.9h-1 M{$\odot$} and \$r=0.1{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!60 {\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ (\$k {\textbackslash}approx 0.05{\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}!20 {\textbackslash}, h {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). The observation that the offset is both mass and scale independent places important constraints on the degree to which astrophysical processes (baryonic effects, assembly bias) can fully explain the effect. This scale independence also suggests that the 'lensing is low' effect on small and large radial scales probably have the same physical origin. Resolutions based on new physics require a nearly uniform suppression, relative to {$\Lambda$}CDM predictions, of the amplitude of matter fluctuations on these scales. The possible causes of this are tightly constrained by measurements of the CMB and of the low-redshift expansion history.},

Unlike rejection-based sampling methods such as vanilla nested sampling (NS) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, importance sampling techniques can use all likelihood evaluations for posterior and evidence estimation. However, for efficient importance sampling, one needs proposal distributions that closely mimic the posterior distributions. We show how to combine INS with deep learning via neural network regression to accomplish this task. We also introduce NAUTILUS, a reference open-source PYTHON implementation of this technique for Bayesian posterior and evidence estimation. We compare NAUTILUS against popular NS and MCMC packages, including EMCEE, DYNESTY, ULTRANEST, and POCOMC, on a variety of challenging synthetic problems and real-world applications in exoplanet detection, galaxy SED fitting and cosmology. In all applications, the sampling efficiency of NAUTILUS is substantially higher than that of all other samplers, often by more than an order of magnitude. Simultaneously, NAUTILUS delivers highly accurate results and needs fewer likelihood evaluations than all other samplers tested. We also show that NAUTILUS has good scaling with the dimensionality of the likelihood and is easily parallelizable to many CPUs.},

The approach is generative: given astronomical sources and a description of the image properties, the code produces pixel-space estimates or predictions of what will be observed in the images. This estimate can be used to produce a likelihood for the observed data given the model: assuming the model space actually includes the truth (it doesn't, in detail), then if we had the optimal model parameters, the predicted image would differ from the actually observed image only by noise. Given a noise model of the instrument and assuming pixelwise independent noise, the log-likelihood is the negative chi-squared difference: (image - model) / noise.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of {\textasciitilde}0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {$<$} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution {\textasciitilde}250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

  abstract = {We present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas in clusters formed in cosmological simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of the overall isopotential surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside the cluster core (r {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1r500) is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations, while in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles into a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas in the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas cooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather well outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller radii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF runs, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally supported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between gas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make the gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally, we use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed in a three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters against observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling in the intracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.},

The HSC wide survey will be the first with the statistical capability of measuring the lensing signal with high signal-to-noise at log(M*)=8. At this same mass scale, LSST will have the most overall constraining power with a predicted signal-to-noise for the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal around dwarfs of SN=200. WFIRST and LSST will have the greatest potential to push below the log(M*) = 7 mass scale thanks to the depth of their imaging data. Studies of the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies at z=0.1 with gravitational lensing are soon within reach. However, further work will be required to develop optimized strategies for extracting dwarfs samples from these surveys, determining redshifts, and accurately measuring lensing on small radial scales. Dwarf lensing will be a new and powerful tool to constrain the halo masses and inner density slopes of dwarf galaxies and to distinguish between baryonic feedback and modified dark matter scenarios.},

  abstract = {Lensing Without Borders is a cross-survey collaboration created to assess the consistency of galaxy-galaxy lensing signals (\${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}Sigma\$) across different data-sets and to carry out end-to-end tests of systematic errors. We perform a blind comparison of the amplitude of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}Sigma\$ using lens samples from BOSS and six independent lensing surveys. We find good agreement between empirically estimated and reported systematic errors which agree to better than 2.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ in four lens bins and three radial ranges. For lenses with \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}{$>$}0.43\$ and considering statistical errors, we detect a 3-4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ correlation between lensing amplitude and survey depth. This correlation could arise from the increasing impact at higher redshift of unrecognised galaxy blends on shear calibration and imperfections in photometric redshift calibration. At \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}{$>$}0.54\$ amplitudes may additionally correlate with foreground stellar density. The amplitude of these trends is within survey-defined systematic error budgets which are designed to include known shear and redshift calibration uncertainty. Using a fully empirical and conservative method, we do not find evidence for large unknown systematics. Systematic errors greater than 15\% (25\%) ruled out in three lens bins at 68\% (95\%) confidence at \$z{$<$}0.54\$. Differences with respect to predictions based on clustering are observed to be at the 20-30\% level. Our results therefore suggest that lensing systematics alone are unlikely to fully explain the "lensing is low" effect at \$z{$<$}0.54\$. This analysis demonstrates the power of cross-survey comparisons and provides a promising path for identifying and reducing systematics in future lensing analyses.},

We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogs trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40\% larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 8\}={\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 8\} {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3\}\$ compared to Planck2015 reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (\$r{$<$}10\$ \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos, and modifications to general relativity on \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}Sigma\$ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effects of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

  abstract = {With a primary goal of conducting precision weak-lensing measurements from space, the COSMOS survey has imaged the largest contiguous area observed by Hubble Space Telescope to date, using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This is the first paper in a series in which we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak-lensing measurements from COSMOS data. We first construct a source catalog from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg2) subsampled at a pixel scale of 0.03". Defects and diffraction spikes are carefully removed, leaving a total of 1.2{\texttimes}106 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. Multiwavelength follow-up observations of the COSMOS field provide photometric redshifts for 73\% of the source galaxies in the lensing catalog. We analyze and discuss the COSMOS redshift distribution and show broad agreement with other surveys to z{\textasciitilde}1. Our next step is to measure the shapes of galaxies and correct them for the distortion induced by the time-varying ACS point-spread function and for charge transfer efficiency (CTE) effects. Simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in transforming shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. For every galaxy we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that intrinsic shape noise varies little with size, magnitude, or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin2, the final COSMOS weak-lensing catalog contains 3.9{\texttimes}105 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak-lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging surveys suffer from projection effects: physically unassociated galaxies along a cluster's line of sight can be counted as its members and boost the observed richness (the number of cluster members). To model the impact projection on cluster cosmology analyses, we apply a halo occupation distribution model to N-body simulations to simulate the red galaxies contributing to cluster members, and we use the number of galaxies in a cylinder along the line-of-sight (counts-in-cylinders) to model the impact of projection on cluster richness. We compare three projection models: uniform, quadratic, and Gaussian, and we convert between them by matching their effective cylinder volumes. We validate our mock catalogs using SDSS redMaPPer data vectors, including cluster abundance vs. richness, stacked lensing signal, spectroscopic redshift distribution of member galaxies, and richness re-measured on a redshift grid. We find the former two are insensitive to the projection model, while the latter two favor a quadratic projection model with a width of 180 Mpc/h (equivalent to the volume of a uniform model with a width of 100 Mpc/h and a Gaussian model with a width of 110 Mpc/h, or a Gaussian redshift error of 0.04). Our framework provides an efficient and flexible way to model optical cluster data vectors, paving the way for a simulation-based joint analysis for clusters, galaxies, and shear.},

Our sample contains 352 simulated clusters spanning a halo mass range of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {$<$} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500c\} / M\_{\textbackslash}odot {$<$} 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ at \$z=0\$. We focus on the proposed classification of clusters into cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) populations, the \$z=0\$ distribution of cluster central ICM properties, and the redshift evolution of the CC cluster population. We analyze resolved structure and radial profiles of entropy, temperature, electron number density, and pressure. To distinguish between CC and NCC clusters, we consider several criteria: central cooling time, central entropy, central density, X-ray concentration parameter, and density profile slope. According to TNG-Cluster and with no a-priori cluster selection, the distributions of these properties are unimodal, whereby CCs and NCCs represent the two extremes. Across the entire TNG-Cluster sample at \$z=0\$ and based on central cooling time, the strong CC fraction is \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SCC\} = 24{\textbackslash}\%\$, compared to \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm WCC\} = 60{\textbackslash}\% \$ and \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NCC\} = 16{\textbackslash}\%\$ for weak and non-cool-cores, respectively. However, the fraction of CCs depends strongly on both halo mass and redshift, although the magnitude and even direction of the trends vary with definition. The abundant statistics of simulated high-mass clusters in TNG-Cluster enables us to match observational samples and make a comparison with data. The CC fractions from \$z=0\$ to \$z=2\$ are in broad agreement with observations, as are radial profiles of thermodynamical quantities, globally as well as split for CC versus NCC halos. TNG-Cluster can therefore be used as a laboratory to study the evolution and transformations of cluster cores due to mergers, AGN feedback, and other physical processes.},

  abstract = {Noise bias is a significant source of systematic error in weak gravitational lensing measurements that must be corrected to satisfy the stringent standards of modern imaging surveys in the era of precision cosmology. This paper reviews the analytical noise bias correction method and provides analytical derivations demonstrating that we can recover shear to its second order using the 'renoising' noise bias correction approach introduced by Metacalibration. We implement this analytical noise bias correction within the AnaCal shear estimation framework and propose several enhancements to the noise bias correction algorithm. We evaluate the improved AnaCal using simulations designed to replicate Rubin LSST imaging data. These simulations feature semi-realistic galaxies and stars, complete with representative distributions of magnitudes and Galactic spatial density. We conduct tests under various observational challenges, including cosmic rays, defective CCD columns, bright star saturation, bleed trails, and spatially variable point spread functions. Our results indicate a multiplicative bias in weak lensing shear recovery of less than a few tenths of a percent, meeting LSST DESC requirements without requiring calibration from external image simulations. Additionally, our algorithm achieves rapid processing, handling one galaxy in less than a millisecond.},

  abstract = {Shear estimation bias from galaxy detection and blending identification is now recognized as an issue for ongoing and future weak-lensing surveys. Currently, the empirical approach to correcting for this bias involves numerically shearing every observed galaxy and rerunning the detection and selection process. In this work, we provide an analytical correction for this bias that is accurate to sub per cent level and far simpler to use. With the interpretation that smoothed image pixel values and galaxy properties are projections of the image signal onto a set of basis functions, we analytically derive the linear shear responses of both the pixel values and the galaxy properties (i.e. magnitude, size, and shape) using the shear responses of the basis functions. With these derived shear responses, we correct for biases from shear-dependent galaxy detection and galaxy sample selection. With the analytical covariance matrix of measurement errors caused by image noise on pixel values and galaxy properties, we correct for the noise biases in galaxy shape measurement and the detection/selection process to the second-order in noise. The code used for this paper can carry out the detection, selection, and shear measurement for {\textasciitilde}1000 galaxies per CPU second. The algorithm is tested with realistic image simulations, and we find, after the analytical correction (without relying on external image calibration) for the detection/selection bias of about \$-4{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$, the multiplicative shear bias is \$-0.12 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ for isolated galaxies; and about \$-0.3 {\textbackslash}pm 0.1{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ for blended galaxies with Hyper Suprime-Cam observational condition.},

We present a new differentiable implementation of our perturbation-based shear estimator (FPFS), using JAX, which is publicly available as part of a new suite of analytic shear algorithms called ANACAL. This code can analytically calibrate the shear response of any non-linear observable constructed with the FPFS shapelets and detection modes utilizing autodifferentiation (AD), generalizing the formalism to include a family of shear estimators with corrections for detection and selection biases. Using the AD capability of JAX, it calculates the full Hessian matrix of the non-linear observables, which improves the previously presented second-order noise bias correction in the shear estimation. As an illustration of the power of the new ANACAL framework, we optimize the effective galaxy number density in the space of the generalized shear estimators using an LSST-like galaxy image simulation for the 10 yr LSST. For the generic shear estimator, the magnitude of the multiplicative bias {\textbar}m{\textbar} is below 3 {\texttimes} 10-3 (99.7 per cent confidence interval), and the effective galaxy number density is improved by 5 per cent . We also discuss some planned future additions to the ANACAL software suite to extend its applicability beyond the FPFS measurements.},

  abstract = {We reinterpret the shear estimator developed by Zhang \& Komatsu within the framework of shapelets and propose the Fourier Power Function Shapelets (FPFS) shear estimator. Four shapelet modes are calculated from the power function of every galaxy's Fourier transform after deconvolving the point-spread function (PSF) in Fourier space. We propose a novel normalization scheme to construct dimensionless ellipticity and its corresponding shear responsivity using these shapelet modes. Shear is measured in a conventional way by averaging the ellipticities and responsivities over a large ensemble of galaxies. With the introduction and tuning of a weighting parameter, noise bias is reduced below one per cent of the shear signal. We also provide an iterative method to reduce selection bias. The FPFS estimator is developed without any assumptions regarding galaxy morphology or any approximations for PSF correction. Moreover, our method does not rely on heavy image manipulations or complicated statistical procedures. We test the FPFS shear estimator using several Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)-like image simulations and the main results are as follows. (i) For simulations that only contain isolated galaxies, the amplitude of the multiplicative bias is below 1 {\texttimes} 10-2. (ii) For more realistic simulations, which also contain blended galaxies, the blended galaxies are deblended by the first-generation HSC deblender before shear measurement. A multiplicative bias of (-5.71 {\textpm} 0.31) {\texttimes} 10-2 is found. The blending bias is calibrated by image simulations. Finally, we test the consistency and stability of this calibration.},

After conservative masking and galaxy selection, the survey covers 416 deg2 of the northern sky with an effective galaxy number density of 15 arcmin-2 over the four redshift bins. The 2PCFs adopted for cosmology analysis are measured in the angular range; 7.1 {$<\theta$} /arcmin {$<$}56.6 for {$\xi$}+ and 31.2 {$<\theta$} /arcmin {$<$}248 for {$\xi$}-, with a total signal-to-noise ratio of 26.6. We apply a conservative, wide, flat prior on the photometric redshift errors on the last two tomographic bins, and the relative magnitudes of the cosmic shear amplitude across four redshift bins allow us to calibrate the photometric redshift errors. With this flat prior on redshift errors, we find {\textohm}m=0.25 6-0.044+0.056 and S8{$\equiv\sigma$}8{\textsurd}\{{\textohm}m/0.3 \}=0.76 9-0.034+0.031 (both 68\% C.I.) for a flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology. We find, after unblinding, that our constraint on S8 is consistent with the Fourier space cosmic shear and the 3 {\texttimes}2 pt analyses on the same HSC dataset. We carefully study the potential systematics from astrophysical and systematic model uncertainties in our fiducial analysis using synthetic data, and report no biases (including projection bias in the posterior space) greater than 0.5 {$\sigma$} in the estimation of S8. Our analysis hints that the mean redshifts of the two highest tomographic bins are higher than initially estimated. In addition, a number of consistency tests are conducted to assess the robustness of our analysis. Comparing our result with Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background observations, we find a {$\sim$}2 {$\sigma$} tension for the {$\Lambda$} CDM model.},

The resulting catalogues enable joint shear and redshift calibration, enhancing the realism and hence accuracy over previous efforts. To create a large volume of simulated galaxies with faithful properties and to a sufficient depth, we integrated cosmological simulations with high-quality imaging observations. We also improved the realism of simulated images by allowing the point spread function (PSF) to differ between CCD images, including stellar density variations and varying noise levels between pointings. Using realistic variable shear fields, we accounted for the impact of blended systems at different redshifts. Although the overall correction is minor, we found a clear redshift-bias correlation in the blending-only variable shear simulations, indicating the non-trivial impact of this higher-order blending effect. We also explored the impact of the PSF modelling errors and found a small yet noticeable effect on the shear bias. Finally, we conducted a series of sensitivity tests, including changing the input galaxy properties. We conclude that our fiducial shape measurement algorithm, lensfit, is robust within the requirements of lensing analyses with KiDS. As for future weak lensing surveys with tighter requirements, we suggest further investments in understanding the impact of blends at different redshifts, improving the PSF modelling algorithm and developing the shape measurement method to be less sensitive to the galaxy properties.},

  abstract = {Cosmological analyses of second-order weak lensing statistics require precise and accurate covariance estimates. These covariances are impacted by two sometimes neglected terms: A negative contribution to the Gaussian covariance due to finite survey area and the super-sample covariance (SSC) which for the power spectrum contains the impact by Fourier modes larger than the survey window. We show here that these two effects are connected and can be seen as correction terms to the ``large-field-approximation'', the asymptotic case of an infinitely large survey area. We describe the two terms collectively as ``Finite-Field-Terms''. We derive the covariance of second-order shear statistics from first principles. For this, we use an estimator in real space without relying on an estimator for the power spectrum. The resulting covariance does not scale inversely with the survey area, as naively assumed. This scaling is only correct under the large-field approximation when the contribution of the finite-field terms tends to zero. Furthermore, all parts of the covariance, not only the SSC, depend on the power- and trispectrum at all modes, including those larger than the survey. We also show that it is generally impossible to transform an estimate for the power spectrum covariance into the covariance of a real-space statistic. Such a transformation is only possible in the asymptotic case of the `large-field approximation'. Additionally, we find that the total covariance of a real-space statistic can be calculated using correlation functions estimates on spatial scales smaller than the survey window. Consequently, estimating covariances of real-space statistics, in principle, does not require information on spatial scales larger than the survey area. We demonstrate that this covariance estimation method is equivalent to the standard sample covariance method.},

There are almost no prolate galaxies with stellar mass smaller than 3 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$}. We check the merger history of the prolate galaxies, and find that they are formed by major dry mergers. All the prolate galaxies have at least one such merger, with most having mass ratios between 1:1 and 1:3. The gas fraction (gas mass to total baryon mass) of the progenitors is 0-3 per cent per cent for nearly all these mergers, except for one whose second progenitor contains {$\sim$} 15 per cent gas mass, while its main progenitor still contains less than 5 per cent. For the 35 massive prolate galaxies that we find, 18 of them have minor-axis rotation, and their angular momenta mostly come from the spin angular momenta of the progenitors (usually that of the main progenitor). We analyse the merger orbits of these prolate galaxies and find that most of them experienced a nearly radial merger orbit. Oblate galaxies with major dry mergers can have either radial or circular merger orbits. We further discuss various properties of these prolate galaxies, such as spin parameter {$\lambda$}R, spherical anisotropy parameter {$\beta$}, dark matter fraction, as well as inner density slopes for the stellar, dark matter and total mass distributions.},

In a statistical sense, DECaLS agrees with HSC to R {$>$} 200 kpc. DECaLS and HSC measurements of the stellar mass contained within 100 kpc agree within 0.05 dex. Finally, we use weak lensing to show that measurements of outer light with DECaLS at 0.19 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.50 show a similar promise as HSC as a low scatter proxy of halo mass. The tests and results from this paper represent an important step forward for accurate measurements of the outer light of massive galaxies and demonstrate that outer light measurements from DECam imaging will be a promising method for finding galaxy clusters.},

  abstract = {Context. The eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), observed with eROSITA ahead of its planned 4-yr all-sky survey, is the largest contiguous-field X-ray survey at present. It yielded a large sample of X-ray sources with very rich multiband photometric and spectroscopic coverage. Aims: We present here the eFEDS active galactic nuclei (AGN) catalog and the eROSITA X-ray spectral properties of the eFEDS sources. Methods: Using a Bayesian method, we performed a systematic X-ray spectral analysis for all the eFEDS sources. We adopted multiple spectral models, including single-component power-law or hot-plasma models and double-component models of a power law plus soft excess. We investigated the capacity of eROSITA X-ray spectra for constraining AGN spectral shapes through a detailed analysis of the posterior parameter probability distribution functions. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to recover the spectral parameter distribution of the sample. The source fluxes and luminosities were measured from the posterior of the spectral fitting. Results: The eFEDS AGN catalog (22 079 sources) comprises {\textasciitilde}80\% of the eFEDS point sources. Despite a large number of faint sources, our spectral fitting provides reasonable measurements of spectral shapes and intrinsic luminosities for a majority of the sources. Because of sample selection bias, this AGN catalog is dominated by X-ray unobscured sources, with an obscured (logNH {$>$} 21.5) fraction of 8\%; the power-law emission of the hot corona is also relatively soft, with a typical slope of 2.0. For type-I AGN, the X-ray emission is well correlated with the UV emission with the usual anticorrelation between the X-ray to UV spectral slope {$\alpha$}OX and the UV luminosity. The X-ray spectral properties measured with various models are presented for all the eFEDS sources. The catalog is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/661/A5},

  abstract = {Aims: The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey has been carried out during the performance verification phase of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA telescope and was completed in November 2019. This survey is designed to provide the first eROSITA-selected sample of clusters and groups and to test the predictions for the all-sky survey in the context of cosmological studies with clusters of galaxies. Methods: In the area of {\textasciitilde}140 square degrees covered by eFEDS, 542 candidate clusters and groups of galaxies were detected as extended X-ray sources with the eSASS source detection algorithm. We performed imaging and spectral analysis of the 542 cluster candidates with eROSITA X-ray data and studied the properties of the sample. Results: We provide the catalog of candidate galaxy clusters and groups detected by eROSITA in the eFEDS field down to a flux of {\textasciitilde}10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) within 1'. The clusters are distributed in the redshift range ɀ = [0.01, 1.3] with a median redshift ɀmedian = 0.35. With eROSITA X-ray data, we measured the temperature of the intracluster medium within two radii, 300 kpc and 500 kpc, and constrained the temperature with {$>$}2{$\sigma$} confidence level for {\textasciitilde}1/5 (102 out of 542) of the sample. The average temperature of these clusters is {\textasciitilde}2 keV. Radial profiles of flux, luminosity, electron density, and gas mass were measured from the precise modeling of the imaging data. The selection function, the purity, and the completeness of the catalog are examined and discussed in detail. The contamination fraction is {\textasciitilde}1/5 in this sample and is dominated by misidentified point sources. The X-ray luminosity function of the clusters agrees well with the results obtained from other recent X-ray surveys. We also find 19 supercluster candidates in this field, most of which are located at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5, including one cluster at ɀ {\textasciitilde} 0.36 that was presented previously. Conclusions: The eFEDS cluster and group catalog at the final eRASS equatorial depth provides a benchmark proof of concept for the eROSITA All-Sky Survey extended source detection and characterization. We confirm the excellent performance of eROSITA for cluster science and expect no significant deviations from our pre-launch expectations for the final all-sky survey.

  abstract = {Dedicated 'Stage IV' observatories will soon observe the entire extragalactic sky, to measure the 'cosmic shear' distortion of galaxy shapes by weak gravitational lensing. To measure the apparent shapes of those galaxies, we present an improved version of the Fourier Power Function Shapelets (FPFS) shear measurement method. This now includes analytic corrections for sources of bias that plague all shape measurement algorithms: Including noise bias (due to noise in non-linear combinations of observable quantities) and selection bias (due to sheared galaxies being more or less likely to be detected). Crucially, these analytic solutions do not rely on calibration from external image simulations. For isolated galaxies, the small residual \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ multiplicative bias and \$\{{\textbackslash}lesssim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ additive bias now meet science requirements for Stage IV experiments. FPFS also works accurately for faint galaxies and robustly against stellar contamination. Future work will focus on deblending overlapping galaxies. The code used for this paper can process \$\{\}1000\$ galaxy images per CPU second and is available from https://github.com/mr-superonion/FPFS.},

  abstract = {Understanding the scaling relation between baryonic observables and dark matter halo properties is crucial not only for studying galaxy formation and evolution, but also for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from galaxy surveys. In this paper, we constrain the stellar-to-halo mass relation of galaxy groups identified by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, using weak lensing signals measured by the Kilo-Degree Survey. We compared our measured scaling relation with predictions from the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations and the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model. We find general agreement between our measurements and simulation predictions for haloes with masses \$\{rsim\}10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\}{\textbackslash} h\_\{70\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, but observe slight discrepancies with the FLAMINGO simulations at lower halo masses. We explored improvements to the current halo model framework by incorporating simulation-informed scatter in the group stellar mass distribution as a function of halo mass. We find that including a simulation-informed scatter model tightens the constraints on scaling relations, despite the current data statistics being insufficient to directly constrain the variable scatter. We also tested the robustness of our results against different statistical models of miscentring effects from selected central galaxies. We find that accounting for miscentring is essential, but our current measurements do not distinguish among different miscentring models.},

  abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

  abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg{\textasciicircum}2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg{\textasciicircum}2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r{\textasciitilde}27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z{\textasciitilde}1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

  abstract = {This paper studies pseudo-bulges (P-bulges) and classical bulges (C-bulges) in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) central galaxies using the new bulge indicator {$\Delta\Sigma$}1, which measures relative central stellar-mass surface density within 1 kpc. We compare {$\Delta\Sigma$}1 to the established bulge-type indicator {$\Delta<\mu$}e{$>$} from Gadotti (2009) and show that classifying by {$\Delta\Sigma$}1 agrees well with {$\Delta<\mu$}e{$>$}. {$\Delta\Sigma$}1 requires no bulge-disc decomposition and can be measured on SDSS images out to z = 0.07. Bulge types using it are mapped on to 20 different structural and stellar-population properties for 12 000 SDSS central galaxies with masses 10.0 {$<$} log M*/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 10.4. New trends emerge from this large sample. Structural parameters show fairly linear log-log relations versus {$\Delta\Sigma$}1 and {$\Delta<\mu$}e{$>$} with only moderate scatter, while stellar-population parameters show a highly non-linear 'elbow' in which specific star formation rate remains roughly flat with increasing central density and then falls rapidly at the elbow, where galaxies begin to quench. P-bulges occupy the low-density end of the horizontal arm of the elbow and are universally star forming, while C-bulges occupy the elbow and the vertical branch and exhibit a wide range of star formation rates at a fixed density. The non-linear relation between central density and star formation rate has been seen before, but this mapping on to bulge class is new. The wide range of star formation rates in C-bulges helps to explain why bulge classifications using different parameters have sometimes disagreed in the past. The elbow-shaped relation between density and stellar indices suggests that central structure and stellar populations evolve at different rates as galaxies begin to quench.},

  abstract = {As the statistical power of galaxy weak lensing reaches~per\,cent level precision, large, realistic, and robust simulations are required to calibrate observational systematics, especially given the increased importance of object blending as survey depths increase. To capture the coupled effects of blending in both shear and photometric redshift calibration, we define the effective redshift distribution for lensing, n{$\gamma$}(z), and describe how to estimate it using image simulations. We use an extensive suite of tailored image simulations to characterize the performance of the shear estimation pipeline applied to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data set. We describe the multiband, multi-epoch simulations, and demonstrate their high level of realism through comparisons to the real DES data. We isolate the effects that generate shear calibration biases by running variations on our fiducial simulation, and find that blending-related effects are the dominant contribution to the mean multiplicative bias of approximately \$-2\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$. By generating simulations with input shear signals that vary with redshift, we calibrate biases in our estimation of the effective redshift distribution, and demonstrate the importance of this approach when blending is present. We provide corrected effective redshift distributions that incorporate statistical and systematic uncertainties, ready for use in DES Year 3 weak lensing analyses.},

  abstract = {We present the results of attempts to detect the ellipticity of dark matter halos using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with SDSS data. We use 2,020,256 galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour and luminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. We search for and identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to a spurious detection. These include systematic shear that leads to a slight spurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (due to contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens source pairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. We develop methods that allow us to remove these contaminants to the signal. We split the analysis into blue (spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. Assuming Gaussian errors as in previous work and a power-law profile, we find f\_h=e\_h/e\_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxies and -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity. Inclusion of the more realistic non-Gaussian error distributions and of the NFW density profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear for scales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and -1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. While there is no concrete detection of alignment in either case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in the brightest lens sample of ellipticals. Our results appear to be mildly inconsistent with a previously reported detection by Hoekstra et al. (2004), but more data and further tests are needed to clarify whether the discrepancy is real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used and analysis methods.},

  abstract = {We present first results from the third GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT3) challenge, the third in a sequence of challenges for testing methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three specific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with constant or cosmologically varying shear fields. The simplest (control) experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function (PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a spatially varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The 24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525 submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear calibration biases by {$\sim$}1 per cent for a wide range of methods. Other effects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the impact of galaxy type as measured by the S{\'e}rsic index, are quantified for the first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and defocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additive shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.},

The GREAT3 challenge is posed to the astronomy, machine learning, and statistics communities, and includes tests of three specific effects that are of immediate relevance to upcoming weak lensing surveys, two of which have never been tested in a community challenge before. These effects include realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from space; spatially varying, physically-motivated blurring kernel; and combination of multiple different exposures.

These include long-standing concerns such as the estimation of coherent shears from galaxy images or redshift distributions of galaxies selected on the basis of photometric redshifts, along with systematic uncertainties that have received less attention to date because they are subdominant contributors to the error budget in current surveys. I also discuss methods for automated systematics detection using survey data of the 2020s.

These simulations include HSC observing conditions and galaxy images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), with fully realistic galaxy morphologies and the impact of nearby galaxies included. We find that the inclusion of nearby galaxies in the images is critical to reproducing the observed distributions of galaxy sizes and magnitudes, due to the non-negligible fraction of unrecognized blends in ground-based data, even with the excellent typical seeing of the HSC survey (0.58 arcsec in the i band). Using these simulations, we detect and remove the impact of selection biases due to the correlation of weights and the quantities used to define the sample (S/N and apparent size) with the lensing shear. We quantify and remove galaxy property-dependent multiplicative and additive shear biases that are intrinsic to our shear estimation method, including an {$\sim$}10 per cent-level multiplicative bias due to the impact of nearby galaxies and unrecognized blends. Finally, we check the sensitivity of our shear calibration estimates to other cuts made on the simulated samples, and find that the changes in shear calibration are well within the requirements for HSC weak lensing analysis. Overall, the simulations suggest that the weak lensing multiplicative biases in the first-year HSC shear catalogue are controlled at the 1 per cent level.},

Our sample consists of 34 galaxies, of halo masses 1011-1012 M{$\odot$} at z = 2, run with and without radiation pressure (RP) feedback from young stars. While RP has little effect on the sizes and global stability of discs, it reduces the amount of star-forming gas by a factor of {$\sim$}2, leading to a similar decrease in stellar mass by z {$\sim$} 2. Both samples undergo extended periods of violent disc instability continuously forming giant clumps of masses 107-109 M{$\odot$} at a similar rate, though RP significantly reduces the number of long-lived clumps (LLCs). When RP is (not) included, clumps with circular velocity {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 (20) km s- 1, baryonic surface density {$\lessequivlnt$} 200 (100)M{$\odot$} pc- 2 and baryonic mass {$\lessequivlnt$} 108.2 (107.3) M{$\odot$} are short-lived, disrupted in a few free-fall times. More massive and dense clumps survive and migrate towards the disc centre over a few disc orbital times. In the RP simulations, the distribution of clump masses and star formation rates (SFRs) normalized to their host disc is similar at all redshifts, exhibiting a truncated power law with a slope slightly shallower than -2. The specific SFR (sSFR) of the LLCs declines with age as they migrate towards the disc centre, producing gradients in mass, stellar age, gas fraction, sSFR and metallicity that distinguish them from the short-lived clumps which tend to populate the outer disc. Ex situ mergers comprise {$\sim$}37 per cent of the mass in clumps and {$\sim$}29 per cent of the SFR. They are more massive and with older stellar ages than the in situ clumps, especially near the disc edge. Roughly half the galaxies at redshifts z = 4-1 are clumpy, with {$\sim$}3-30 per cent of their SFR and {$\sim$}0.1-3 per cent of their stellar mass in clumps.},

Extended gas discs exist in 83 per cent of the snapshots. Clumps are identified by gas density in 3D and their stellar and dark matter components are considered thereafter. While most of the overdensities are diffuse and elongated, 91 per cent of their mass and 83 per cent of their star formation rate (SFR) are in compact round clumps. Nearly all galaxies have a central, massive bulge clump, while 70 per cent of the discs show off-centre clumps, 3-4 per galaxy. The fraction of clumpy discs peaks at intermediate disc masses. Clumps are divided based on dark matter content into in situ and ex situ originating from violent disc instability (VDI) and minor mergers, respectively. 60 per cent of the discs are in a VDI phase showing off-centre in situ clumps, which contribute 1-7 per cent of the disc mass and 5-45 per cent of its SFR. The in situ clumps constitute 75 per cent of the off-centre clumps in terms of number and SFR but only half the mass, each clump containing on average 1 per cent of the disc mass and 6 per cent of its SFR. They have young stellar ages, 100-400 Myr, and high specific SFR (sSFR), 1-10 Gyr-1. They exhibit gradients resulting from inward clump migration, where the inner clumps are somewhat more massive and older, with lower gas fraction and sSFR and higher metallicity. Similar observed gradients indicate that clumps survive outflows. The ex situ clumps have stellar ages 0.5-3 Gyr and sSFR {$\sim$}0.1-2 Gyr-1, and they exhibit weaker gradients. Massive clumps of old stars at large radii are likely ex situ mergers, though half of them share the disc rotation.},

Such data sets, where the population being investigated is of unknown size and only partially represented in the data, are called `truncated' in the statistical literature. Truncation can be accounted for through a relatively straightforward modification to the model being fitted in many circumstances, provided that the model can be extended to describe the population of undetected sources. Here, I examine the problem of regression using truncated data in general terms, and use a simple example to show the impact of selecting a subset of potential data on the dependent variable, on the independent variable, and on a second dependent variable that is correlated with the variable of interest. Special circumstances in which selection effects are ignorable are noted. I also comment on computational strategies for performing regression with truncated data, as an extension of methods that have become popular for the non-truncated case, and provide some general recommendations.},

Our data set consists of 238 cluster detections from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT. Here we describe and implement a new statistical framework required to self-consistently produce simultaneous constraints on cosmology and scaling relations from such data, and present results on models of dark energy. In spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, the cluster data yield {\textohm}m = 0.23 +/- 0.04,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.82 +/- 0.05 and w = -1.01 +/- 0.20, incorporating standard priors on the Hubble parameter and mean baryon density of the Universe, and marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. These constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in the form of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, type Ia supernovae, cluster gas mass fractions, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic shear. The combination of our data with current microwave background, supernova, gas mass fraction and baryon acoustic oscillation data yields {\textohm}m = 0.27 +/- 0.02,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.79 +/- 0.03 and w = -0.96 +/- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. The combined data also allow us to investigate evolving w models. Marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, we constrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectively w0 = -0.88 +/- 0.21 and wet = -1.05+0.20-0.36, again including conservative systematic allowances. The combined data provide constraints equivalent to a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 15.5. Our results highlight the power of X-ray studies, which enable the straightforward production of large, complete and pure cluster samples and admit tight scaling relations, to constrain cosmology. However, the new statistical framework we apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at other wavelengths.},

  abstract = {This is the second in a series of papers in which we derive simultaneous constraints on cosmology and X-ray scaling relations using observations of massive, X-ray flux-selected galaxy clusters. The data set consists of 238 clusters with 0.1-2.4keV luminosities {$>$}2.5 {\texttimes} 1044h-270ergs-1, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT (11 were observed with both). The clusters are drawn from three samples based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey: the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (78/37 clusters detected/followed-up), the ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-ray sample (126/25) and the bright sub-sample of the Massive Cluster Survey (34/32). Our analysis accounts self-consistently for all selection effects, covariances and systematic uncertainties. Here we describe the reduction of the follow-up X-ray observations, present results on the cluster scaling relations, and discuss their implications. Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass relations, measured within r500, lead to three important results. First, the data support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium (or a combination of heating and condensation of the coldest gas) has altered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally dominated system; however, this excess heat is primarily limited to the central regions of clusters (r {$<$} 0.15r500). Secondly, the intrinsic scatter in the centre-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being bounded at the {$<$}10 per cent level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under investigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or YX-mass relations (10-15 per cent). Thirdly, the evolution with redshift of the scaling relations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of gravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating the central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit of our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved strongly since then. Our results provide a new benchmark for comparison with numerical simulations of cluster formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on the scaling relations of galaxy cluster X-ray luminosity, temperature and gas mass (and derived quantities) with mass and redshift, employing masses from robust weak gravitational lensing measurements. These are the first such results obtained from an analysis that simultaneously accounts for selection effects and the underlying mass function, and directly incorporates lensing data to constrain total masses. Our constraints on the scaling relations and their intrinsic scatters are in good agreement with previous studies, and reinforce a picture in which departures from self-similar scaling laws are primarily limited to cluster cores. However, the data are beginning to reveal new features that have implications for cluster astrophysics and provide new tests for hydrodynamical simulations. We find a positive correlation in the intrinsic scatters of luminosity and temperature at fixed mass, which is related to the dynamical state of the clusters. While the evolution of the nominal scaling relations over the redshift range 0.0 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.5 is consistent with self-similarity, we find tentative evidence that the luminosity and temperature scatters, respectively, decrease and increase with redshift. Physically, this likely related to the development of cool cores and the rate of major mergers. We also examine the scaling relations of redMaPPer richness and Compton Y from Planck. While the richness-mass relation is in excellent agreement with recent work, the measured Y-mass relation departs strongly from that assumed in the Planck cluster cosmology analysis. The latter result is consistent with earlier comparisons of lensing and Planck scaling relation-derived masses.},

  abstract = {The forthcoming decades will see a rapid development of space programs aiming at the implementation of habitats on our satellite. Therefore it makes sense to evaluate the feasibility of a permanent cosmic-ray (CR) observatory on the Moon. Its large sensitive area would allow to carry out a very rich observational program over a time span of a few decades with an unprecedented energy reach. A thorough exploration of the energy region around the CR spectral anomaly located at a few PeV, also known as the "knee", will become possible. In this paper we propose an innovative concept of a modular lunar observatory designed to overcome the limitations of the present generation of cosmic-ray telescopes in Low Earth Orbit. It consists of an array of fully independent modules with limited individual size and weight. This would allow an ample flexibility in the gradual deployment of a progressively larger active volume, while ensuring the collection of meaningful scientific data during the intermediate stages of its implementation. Each independent module consists of three main instruments: a combined Charge and Time-of-Flight detector to identify individual elements from proton to nickel (and beyond), a tracker providing the direction and impact point of the incident particle, and a calorimeter to measure its kinetic energy. The design of each instrument contains innovative solutions that are well within the reach of the present technology.},

  abstract = {The stellar stripping of satellites in cluster haloes is understood to play an important role in the production of intracluster light. Increasingly, cosmological simulations have been utilized to investigate its origin and assembly. However, such simulations typically model individual galaxies at relatively coarse resolutions, raising concerns about their accuracy. Although there is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the accurate recovery of the mass-loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has been no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to accurately recover stellar mass-loss rates in galaxy clusters. Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo represented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence tests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening length on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital configurations, satellite masses, and satellite morphologies. We find that stellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution. Resolving the central regions of satellite DM haloes is critical to accurately recover stellar mass-loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner profiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of the satellite galaxy, this leads to significant overstripping. To prevent this, relatively high DM mass resolutions of around \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, better than those achieved by many contemporary cosmological simulations, are necessary.},

We extend the `Cartesian shapelet' formalism from earlier work, and construct `polar shapelet' basis functions that separate an image into components with explicit rotational symmetries. These frequently provide a more compact parametrization, and can be interpreted in an intuitive way. Image manipulation in shapelet space is simplified by the concise expressions for linear coordinate transformations, and shape measures (including object photometry, astrometry and galaxy morphology estimators) take a naturally elegant form. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of astronomical survey images, and we test shapelet techniques upon real data from the Hubble Space Telescope. We present a practical method to automatically optimize the quality of an arbitrary shapelet decomposition in the presence of observational noise, pixelization and a point spread function. A central component of this procedure is the adaptive choice of the scale size and the truncation order of the shapelet expansion. A complete software package to perform shapelet image analysis is made available on the World Wide Web.},

Shear causes galaxy shapes to become elongated, and is sensitive to the second derivative of the projected gravitational potential along their line of sight; flexion bends galaxy shapes into arcs, and is sensitive to the third derivative. Polar shapelets provide a natural representation, in which both shear and flexion transformations are compact. Through this tool, we understand progress in several weak lensing methods. We then exploit various symmetries of shapelets to construct a range of shear estimators with useful properties. Through an analogous investigation, we also explore several flexion estimators. In particular, some of the estimators can be measured simultaneously and independently for every galaxy, and will provide unique checks for systematics in future weak lensing analyses. Using simulated images from the Shear TEsting Programme, we show that we can recover input shears with no significant bias.

We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation. The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo mass. At z = 0.1, it declines from 0.25 dex at M200, DMO {$\approx$} 1011 M{$\odot$} to 0.12 dex at M200, DMO {$\approx$} 1013 M{$\odot$}, but the trend is weak above 1012 M{$\odot$}. For M200, DMO {$<$} 1012.5 M{$\odot$} up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, Vmax, DMO, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the M\_star - M\_\{200, DMO\} relation, and it does not explain the scatter in Mstar-Vmax, DMO. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

Our target is the identification of possible (young and recycled) pulsar candidates in the sample of 2600 unassociated \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray sources, via their characteristic X-ray and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray emission. To achieve this, we cross-match the Fermi-LAT catalog with the catalog of X-ray sources in the western Galactic hemisphere from the first four all-sky surveys of SRG/eROSITA. We complement this by identifying X-ray counterparts of known pulsars detected at \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray and radio energies in the eROSITA data. We use a Bayesian cross-matching scheme to construct a probabilistic catalog of possible pulsar-type X-ray counterparts to Fermi-LAT sources. Our method combines the overlap of X-ray and \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray source positions with a probabilistic classification (into pulsar and blazar candidates) of each source based on its \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray properties and a prediction on the X-ray flux of pulsar- or blazar-type counterparts. We provide a catalog of our prior \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray-based classifications of all 2600 unassociated sources in the Fermi-LAT catalog, with around equal numbers of pulsar and blazar candidates. Our final list of candidate X-ray pulsar counterparts, cleaned for spurious detections and sources with obvious non-pulsar counterparts, contains around 900 X-ray sources. We predict between 30 and 40 new pulsars among our top 200 candidates, with around equal expected numbers of young and recycled pulsars. This candidate list may serve as input to future follow-up campaigns, looking directly for pulsations or for the orbital modulation of possible binary companions. We furthermore detect the X-ray counterparts of 15 known rotation-powered pulsars, which were not seen in X-rays before.},

  abstract = {Analysis of microwave sky signals, such as the cosmic microwave background, often requires component separation with multi-frequency methods, where different signals are isolated by their frequency behaviors. Many so-called "blind" methods, such as the internal linear combination (ILC), make minimal assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data that \${\textbackslash}textit\{do not contain the signal\}\$, and combine the resulting ML-predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices, to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.},

By modeling the scaling relation as \${\textbackslash}langle M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200m\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}lambda,z{\textbackslash}rangle = M\_0 ({\textbackslash}lambda/40){\textasciicircum}F ((1+z)/1.35){\textasciicircum}G\$, we constrain the normalization of the scaling relation at the 5.0 per cent level as \$M\_0 = [3.081 {\textbackslash}pm 0.075 (\{{\textbackslash}rm stat\}) {\textbackslash}pm 0.133 (\{{\textbackslash}rm sys\})] {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ at \${\textbackslash}lambda=40\$ and \$z=0.35\$.

These are the tightest measurements of the normalization and richness scaling index made to date. We use a semi-analytic covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak lensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentering, cluster member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, which dominates the uncertainty on \$M\_0\$. Our result is in excellent agreement with, but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a tool for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid and WFIRST.},

  abstract = {The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of the electron density and magnetic field in galaxy clusters. We have developed a new Bayesian framework {\textbackslash}texttt\{SpectrAx\} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. By using the simulated data for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.},

  abstract = {We use weak-lensing shear measurements to determine the mean mass of optically selected galaxy clusters in Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data. In a blinded analysis, we split the sample of more than 8000 redMaPPer clusters into 15 subsets, spanning ranges in the richness parameter 5 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 180 and redshift 0.2 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 0.8, and fit the averaged mass density contrast profiles with a model that accounts for seven distinct sources of systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors; cluster-member contamination; miscentring; deviations from the NFW halo profile; halo triaxiality and line-of-sight projections. We combine the inferred cluster masses to estimate the joint scaling relation between mass, richness and redshift, M({$\lambda$} ,z) {$\propto$} M\_0 {$\lambda$} F (1+z)G. We find M\_0 {$\equiv$} {$<$} M\_\{200m\} {\textbar} {$\lambda$} =30,z=0.5 {\textbackslash}rangle =[ 2.35 {\textpm} 0.22 \{(stat)\} {\textpm} 0.12 \{(sys)\} ] {\texttimes} 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_\{{$\odot$}\}, with F = 1.12 {\textpm} 0.20 \{(stat)\} {\textpm} 0.06 \{(sys)\} and G = 0.18 {\textpm} 0.75 \{(stat)\} {\textpm} 0.24 \{(sys)\}. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of redMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. and with the Saro et al. calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our results extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from z {$\leq$} 0.3 to z {$\leq$} 0.8. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric redshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial improvements for forthcoming studies.},

  abstract = {Models that connect galaxy and halo properties often summarize a halo's mass accretion history (MAH) with a single value and use this value as the basis for predictions. However, a single-value summary fails to capture the complexity of MAHs and information can be lost in the process. We present MultiCAM, a generalization of traditional abundance matching frameworks, which can simultaneously connect the full MAH of a halo with multiple halo and/or galaxy properties. As a first case study, we apply MultiCAM to the problem of connecting dark matter halo properties to their MAHs in the context of a dark matter-only simulation. While some halo properties, such as concentration, are more strongly correlated to the early-time mass growth of a halo, others, like the virial ratio, have stronger correlations with late-time mass growth. This highlights the necessity of considering the impact of the entire MAH on halo properties. For most of the halo properties we consider, we find that MultiCAM models that use the full MAH achieve higher accuracy than conditional abundance matching models that use a single epoch. We also demonstrate an extension of MultiCAM that captures the covariance between predicted halo properties. This extension provides a baseline model for applications where the covariance between predicted properties is important.},

  abstract = {The eROSITA telescope array aboard the Spektrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) satellite began surveying the sky in December 2019, with the aim of producing all-sky X-ray source lists and sky maps of an unprecedented depth. Here we present catalogues of both point-like and extended sources using the data acquired in the first six months of survey operations (eRASS1; completed June 2020) over the half sky whose proprietary data rights lie with the German eROSITA Consortium. We describe the observation process, the data analysis pipelines, and the characteristics of the X-ray sources. With nearly 930 000 entries detected in the most sensitive 0.2-2.3 keV energy range, the eRASS1 main catalogue presented here increases the number of known X-ray sources in the published literature by more than 60\%, and provides a comprehensive inventory of all classes of X-ray celestial objects, covering a wide range of physical processes. A smaller catalogue of 5466 sources detected in the less sensitive but harder 2.3-5 keV band is the result of the first true imaging survey of the entire sky above 2 keV. We present methods to identify and flag potential spurious sources in the catalogues, which we applied for this work, and we tested and validated the astrometric accuracy via cross-comparison with other X-ray and multi-wavelength catalogues. We show that the number counts of X-ray sources in eRASSl are consistent with those derived over narrower fields by past X-ray surveys of a similar depth, and we explore the number counts variation as a function of the location in the sky. Adopting a uniform all-sky flux limit (at 50\% completeness) of F05-2 keV {$>$} 5 {\texttimes} 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2, we estimate that the eROSITA all-sky survey resolves into individual sources about 20\% of the cosmic X-ray background in the 1-2 keV range. The catalogues presented here form part of the first data release (DR1) of the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Beyond the X-ray catalogues, DR1 contains all detected and calibrated event files, source products (light curves and spectra), and all-sky maps. Illustrative examples of these are provided.

  abstract = {Low surface brightness galactic stellar haloes provide a challenging but promising path towards unravelling the past assembly histories of individual galaxies. Here, we present detailed comparisons between the stellar haloes of Milky Way-mass disc galaxies observed as part of the Dragonfly Nearby Galaxies Survey (DNGS) and stellar mass-matched galaxies in the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG project. We produce stellar mass maps as well as mock g- and r-band images for randomly oriented simulated galaxies, convolving the latter with the Dragonfly point spread function (PSF) and taking care to match the background noise, surface brightness limits, and spatial resolution of DNGS. We measure azimuthally averaged stellar mass density and surface brightness profiles, and find that the DNGS galaxies generally have less stellar mass (or light) at large radii ({$>$}20 kpc) compared to their mass-matched TNG100 counterparts, and that simulated galaxies with similar surface density profiles tend to have low accreted mass fractions for their stellar mass. We explore potential solutions to this apparent 'missing outskirts problem' by implementing several ad hoc adjustments within TNG100 at the stellar particle level. Although we are unable to identify any single adjustment that fully reconciles the differences between the observed and simulated galaxy outskirts, we find that artificially delaying the disruption of satellite galaxies and reducing the spatial extent of in-situ stellar populations result in improved matches between the outer profile shapes and stellar halo masses, respectively. Further insight can be achieved with higher resolution simulations that are able to better resolve satellite accretion, and with larger samples of observed galaxies.},

The overlap between the two surveys in this work is 33.8 square degrees, before masking bright stars. The signal-to-noise ratio of individual cluster lensing measurements ranges from 2.2 to 8.7, with a total of 11.1 for the stacked cluster weak-lensing signal. We fit for an average weak-lensing mass distribution using three different profiles, a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, a dark-matter-only emulated profile, and a full cosmological hydrodynamic emulated profile. We interpret the differences among the masses inferred by these models as a systematic error of 10\%, which is currently smaller than the statistical error. We obtain the ratio of the SZ-estimated mass to the lensing-estimated mass (the so-called hydrostatic mass bias 1-b) of , which is comparable to previous SZ-selected clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and from the Planck Satellite. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for cosmological parameters inferred from cluster abundances compared to cosmic microwave background primary anisotropy measurements.},

We find that the stellar masses and star formation rates of our simulated BCGs are in good agreement with observations at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.4, and that they have experienced, on average, {\textasciitilde}2 ({\textasciitilde}3) major mergers since z = 1 (z = 2). Separating the BCG from the intracluster light (ICL) by means of a fixed 30 kpc aperture, we find that the fraction of stellar mass contributed by ex situ (i.e. accreted) stars at z = 0 is approximately 70, 80, and 90 per cent for the BCG, BCG + ICL, and ICL, respectively. Tracking our simulated BCGs back in time using the merger trees, we find that they became dominated by ex situ stars at z {\textasciitilde}1-2, and that half of the stars that are part of the BCG at z = 0 formed early (z {\textasciitilde} 3) in other galaxies, but 'assembled' onto the BCG until later times (z {$\approx$} 0.8 for the whole sample, z {$\approx$} 0.5 for BCGs in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200\}{\textbackslash}ge 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ haloes). Finally, we show that the stellar mass profiles of BCGs are often dominated by ex situ stars at all radii, with stars from major mergers being found closer to the centre, while stars that were tidally stripped from other galaxies dominate the outer regions.},

These are the structures at very low stellar surface densities, largely unseen by even current wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey. Studying this domain promises to be transformative for our understanding of star formation in low-mass galaxies, the hierarchical assembly of galaxies and galaxy clusters, and the nature of dark matter. It is thus essential to reach depths beyond \${\textbackslash}mu\_V\$ = 30 AB mag/arcsec\${\textasciicircum}2\$ to detect the faintest extragalactic sources, such as dwarf galaxies and the stellar halos around galaxies and within galaxy clusters. The High Latitude Wide Area Survey offers a unique opportunity to statistically study the LSB universe at unprecedented depths in the IR over an area of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2000 square degrees. The high spatial resolution will minimize source confusion, allowing an unbiased characterization of LSB structures, including the identification of stars in nearby LSB galaxies and globular clusters. In addition, the combination of Roman with other upcoming deep imaging observatories (such as Rubin) will provide multi-wavelength coverage to derive photometric redshifts and infer the stellar populations of LSB objects.},

The atlas delivers precise coordinates, multiwavelength mosaics, azimuthally averaged optical surface-brightness profiles, model images and photometry, and additional ancillary metadata for the full sample. Coupled with existing and forthcoming optical spectroscopy from the DESI, the SGA-2020 will facilitate new detailed studies of the star formation and mass assembly histories of nearby galaxies; enable precise measurements of the local velocity field via the Tully-Fisher and fundamental plane relations; serve as a reference sample of lasting legacy value for time-domain and multimessenger astronomical events; and more.},

  abstract = {We reassess the galaxy size-mass relation out to z {$\sim$} 3 using a new definition of size and a sample of {$>$}29,000 galaxies from the 3D-HST, CANDELS, and COSMOS-DASH surveys. Instead of the half-light radius r 50 we use r 80, the radius containing 80\% of the stellar light. We find that the r 80-M * relation has the form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slope at a pivot mass M p. Below the pivot mass the relation is shallow (\{r\}80{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}* 0.15); above it, it is steep (\{r\}80{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}* 0.6). The pivot mass increases with redshift, from \{log\}(\{M\}\{\{p\}\}/\{M\}{$\odot$} ){$\approx$} 10.2 at z = 0.4 to \{log\}(\{M\}\{\{p\}\}/\{M\}{$\odot$} ){$\approx$} 10.9 at z = 1.7-3. We compare these \{r\}80\{--\}\{M\}* relations to the \{M\}halo\vphantom\{\}\{--\}\{M\}* relations derived from galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering analyses, and abundance matching techniques. Remarkably, the pivot stellar masses of both relations are consistent with each other at all redshifts, and the slopes are very similar both above and below the pivot when assuming \{M\}halo\vphantom\{\}{\textbackslash}propto \{r\}803. The implied scaling factor to relate galaxy size to halo size is r 80/R vir = 0.047, independent of stellar mass and redshift. From redshift 0 to 1.5, the pivot mass also coincides with the mass where the fraction of star-forming galaxies is 50\%, suggesting that the pivot mass reflects a transition from dissipational to dissipationless galaxy growth. Finally, our results imply that the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass is relatively small for massive halos ({$\sim$}0.2 dex for \{M\}halo\vphantom\{\}{$>$} \{10\}12.5\{M\}{$\odot$} ).},

  abstract = {Detecting cosmic gamma rays at high rates is the key to time-resolve the acceleration of particles within some of the most powerful events in the universe. Time-resolving the emission of gamma rays from merging celestial bodies, apparently random bursts of gamma rays, recurring novas in binary systems, flaring jets from active galactic nuclei, clocking pulsars, and many more became a critical contribution to astronomy. For good timing on account of high rates, we would ideally collect the naturally more abundant, low energetic gamma rays in the domain of one giga electronvolt in large areas. Satellites detect low energetic gamma rays but only in small collecting areas. Cherenkov telescopes have large collecting areas but can only detect the rare, high energetic gamma rays. To detect gamma rays with lower energies, Cherenkov-telescopes need to increase in precision and size. But when we push the concept of the -far/tele- seeing Cherenkov telescope accordingly, the telescope's physical limits show more clearly. The narrower depth-of-field of larger mirrors, the aberrations of mirrors, and the deformations of mirrors and mechanics all blur the telescope's image. To overcome these limits, we propose to record the -full/plenum- Cherenkov-light field of an atmospheric shower, i.e. recording the directions and impacts of each individual Cherenkov photon simultaneously, with a novel class of instrument. This novel Cherenkov plenoscope can turn a narrow depth-of-field into the perception of depth, can compensate aberrations, and can tolerate deformations. We design a Cherenkov plenoscope to explore timing by detecting low energetic gamma rays in large areas.},

  abstract = {We constrain the scaling relation between optical richness ({$\lambda$}) and halo mass (M) for a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) galaxy clusters within the context of the Planck cosmological model. We use a forward modeling approach where we model the probability distribution of optical richness for a given mass, P(\{ln\}{$\lambda$} {\textbar} M). To model the abundance and the stacked lensing profiles, we use an emulator specifically built to interpolate the halo mass function and the stacked lensing profile for an arbitrary set of halo mass and redshift, which is calibrated based on a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We apply our method to 8312 SDSS redMaPPer clusters with 20 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 100 and 0.10 {$\leq$} z {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 0.33 and show that the lognormal distribution model for P({$\lambda$} {\textbar} M), with four free parameters, well reproduces the measured abundances and lensing profiles simultaneously. The constraints are characterized by the mean relation, {$<$} \{ln\}{$\lambda$} {$>$} (M)=A+B\{ln\}(M/\{M\}pivot\vphantom\{\}), with A=\{3.207\}-0.046+0.044 and B=\{0.993\}-0.055+0.041 (68\% CL), where the pivot mass scale M pivot = 3 {\texttimes} 1014 h -1 M {$\odot$}, and the scatter \{{$\sigma$} \}ln{$\lambda$} {\textbar} M\vphantom\{\}=\{{$\sigma$} \}0+q\{ln\}(M/\{M\}pivot\vphantom\{\}) with \{{$\sigma$} \}0=\{0.456\}-0.039+0.047 and q=-\{0.169\}-0.026+0.035. We find that a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest-richness bins (20 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 30) in order to reproduce the measurements. Without such a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing profiles tends to overestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination of intrinsically low-richness clusters due to the projection effects. Such a low-mass halo contribution is significantly reduced when applying our method to the sample of 30 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 100.},

  abstract = {Determining the distribution of redshifts of galaxies observed by wide-field photometric experiments like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an essential component to mapping the matter density field with gravitational lensing. In this work we describe the methods used to assign individual weak lensing source galaxies from the DES Year 3 Weak Lensing Source Catalogue to four tomographic bins and to estimate the redshift distributions in these bins. As the first application of these methods to data, we validate that the assumptions made apply to the DES Y3 weak lensing source galaxies and develop a full treatment of systematic uncertainties. Our method consists of combining information from three independent likelihood functions: self-organizing map p(z) (SOMPZ), a method for constraining redshifts from galaxy photometry; clustering redshifts (WZ), constraints on redshifts from cross-correlations of galaxy density functions; and shear ratios (SRs), which provide constraints on redshifts from the ratios of the galaxy-shear correlation functions at small scales. Finally, we describe how these independent probes are combined to yield an ensemble of redshift distributions encapsulating our full uncertainty. We calibrate redshifts with combined effective uncertainties of {$\sigma\langle$}z{$\rangle$} {\textasciitilde} 0.01 on the mean redshift in each tomographic bin.},

  abstract = {Projection effects, whereby galaxies along the line-of-sight to a galaxy cluster are mistakenly associated with the cluster halo, present a significant challenge for optical cluster cosmology. We use statistically representative spectral coverage of luminous galaxies to investigate how projection effects impact the low-redshift limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue. Spectroscopic redshifts enable us to differentiate true cluster members from false positives and determine the fraction of candidate cluster members viewed in projection. Our main results can be summarized as follows: first, we show that a simple double-Gaussian model can be used to describe the distribution of line-of-sight velocities in the redMaPPer sample; second, the incidence of projection effects is substantial, accounting for \${\textbackslash}sim 16\$ per cent of the weighted richness for the lowest richness objects; third, projection effects are a strong function of richness, with the contribution in the highest richness bin being several times smaller than for low-richness objects; fourth, our measurement has a similar amplitude to state-of-the-art models, but finds a steeper dependence of projection effects on richness than these models; and fifth, the slope of the observed velocity dispersion--richness relation, corrected for projection effects, implies an approximately linear relationship between the true, three-dimensional halo mass and three-dimensional richness. Our results provide a robust, empirical description of the impact of projection effects on the SDSS redMaPPer cluster sample and exemplify the synergies between optical imaging and spectroscopic data for studies of galaxy cluster astrophysics and cosmology.},

  abstract = {Using a high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the formation of a massive spheroidal galaxy we show that elliptical galaxies can be very compact and massive at high redshift in agreement with recent observations. Accretion of stripped infalling stellar material increases the size of the system with time and the central concentration is reduced by dynamical friction of the surviving stellar cores. In a specific case of a spheroidal galaxy with a final stellar mass of 1.5 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun we find that the effective radius re increases from 0.7 {\textpm} 0.2 kpc at z = 3 to re = 2.4 {\textpm} 0.4 kpc at z = 0 with a concomitant decrease in the effective density of an order of magnitude and a decrease of the central velocity dispersion by approximately 20\% over this time interval. A simple argument based on the virial theorem shows that during the accretion of weakly bound material (minor mergers) the radius can increase as the square of the mass in contrast to the usual linear rate of increase for major mergers. By undergoing minor mergers compact high-redshift spheroids can evolve into present-day systems with sizes and concentrations similar to observed local ellipticals. This indicates that minor mergers may be the main driver for the late evolution of sizes and densities of early-type galaxies.},

Here we investigate the elemental distributions of stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$}) {$\sim$} 9.7-11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star-neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z {$\approx$} 2-4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.},

  abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2 {\texttimes} 25003 resolution elements in a volume 20 times larger. Here, we present first results on the galaxy colour bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g - r) colours of 109 {$<$} M{$\star$}/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 1012.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M{$\star$} {$\sim$} 1010.5 M{$\odot$}. Investigating the build-up of the colour-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale {$\Delta$}tgreen is {$\sim$}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M{$\star$} {$>$} 1011 M{$\odot$} which redden at z {$<$} 1 accumulate on average {$\sim$}25 per cent of their final z = 0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {$\sim$}18 per cent of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

TNG includes a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, and each TNG simulation self-consistently solves for the coupled evolution of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive black holes from early time to the present day, z=0. Each of the flagship runs---TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300---are accompanied by halo/subhalo catalogs, merger trees, lower-resolution and dark-matter only counterparts, all available with 100 snapshots. We discuss scientific and numerical cautions and caveats relevant when using TNG. The data volume now directly accessible online is {$\sim$}750 TB, including 1200 full volume snapshots and {$\sim$}80,000 high time-resolution subbox snapshots. This will increase to {$\sim$}1.1 PB with the future release of TNG50. Data access and analysis examples are available in IDL, Python, and Matlab. We describe improvements and new functionality in the web-based API, including on-demand visualization and analysis of galaxies and halos, exploratory plotting of scaling relations and other relationships between galactic and halo properties, and a new JupyterLab interface.

Here, we show how `slicing' the correlation function on local density brings sensitivity to interesting non-Gaussian features in the large-scale structure, such as the expansion or contraction of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) according to the local density. The sliced correlation function measures the large-scale flows that smear out the BAO, instead of just correcting them as reconstruction algorithms do. Thus, we expect the sliced correlation function to be useful in constraining the growth factor, and modified gravity theories that involve the local density. Out of the studied cases, we find that the run of the BAO peak location with density is best revealed when slicing on an {$\sim$}40 h-1Mpc filtered density. But slicing on an {$\sim$}100 h-1 Mpc filtered density may be most useful in distinguishing between underdense and overdense regions, whose BAO peaks are separated by a substantial {$\sim$}5 h-1 Mpc at z = 0. We also introduce `curtain plots' showing how local densities drive particle motions towards or away from each other over the course of an N-body simulation.},

We assess the performance of the emulator using a validation set of \$N\$-body simulations that are not used in training the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo-matter cross correlation, relevant for galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ and the halo auto-correlation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than \$4{\textbackslash}\%\$. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. It can be used to study properties of halo mass density profiles such as the mass-concentration relation and splashback radius for different cosmologies. The emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo-galaxy connection such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs, to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics such as the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the \$w\$CDM cosmologies, in a few CPU seconds.},

In this region, the majority of filamentary mass, halo mass and galaxy richness centred upon the cluster tends to lie in sheets, which are not always coincident. Fixing a sheet width of 3 Mpc h-1 for definiteness, we find the sheet orientations and (connected) filamentary mass, halo mass and richness fractions relative to the surrounding sphere. Filaments usually have one or more end points outside the sheet determined by filament or halo mass or richness, with at least one having a large probability to be aligned with the perpendicular of the plane. Scatter in mock cluster mass measurements, for several observables, is often correlated with the observational direction relative to these local sheets, most often for richness and weak lensing, somewhat less for Compton decrement and least often for velocity dispersions. The long axis of the cluster also tends to lie in the sheets and its orientation relative to the line of sight also correlates with mass scatter.},

  abstract = {Massive halos hosting groups and clusters of galaxies imprint coherent, arcminute-scale features across the spectrophotometric sky, especially optical-IR clusters of galaxies, distortions in the sub-mm CMB, and extended sources of X-ray emission. Statistical modeling of such features often rely upon the evolving space-time density of dark matter halos -- the halo mass function (HMF) -- as a common theoretical ground for cosmological, astrophysical and fundamental physics studies. We propose a compact (eight parameter) representation of the HMF with readily interpretable parameters that stem from polynomial expansions, first in terms of log-mass, then expanding those coefficients similarly in redshift. We demonstrate good (\${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}! 5{\textbackslash}\%\$) agreement of this form, referred to as the dual-quadratic (DQ-HMF), with Mira-Titan N-body emulator estimates for halo masses above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13.7\} h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ over the redshift range \$0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.5\$, present best-fit parameters for a Planck 2018 cosmology, and present parameter variation in the \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 - {\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ plane. Convolving with a minimal mass-observable relation (MOR) yields closed-form expressions for counts, mean mass, and mass variance of cluster samples characterized by some observable property. Performing information-matrix forecasts of potential parameter constraints from existing and future surveys under different levels of systematic uncertainties, we demonstrate the potential for percent-level constraints on model parameters by an LSST-like optical cluster survey of 300,000 clusters and a richness-mass variance of \$0.3{\textasciicircum}2\$. Even better constraints could potentially be achieved by a survey with one-tenth the sample size but with a reduced selection property variance of \$0.1{\textasciicircum}2\$. Potential benefits and extensions to the basic MOR parameterization are discussed.},

We run the algorithm on {$\sim$}11 960 deg2 of imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 to construct a catalogue of 71 743 clusters in the redshift range 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.6 with richness after correcting for the incompleteness of the richness estimate greater than 20. We cross-match the cluster catalogue with external cluster catalogues to find that our photometric cluster redshift estimates are accurate with low bias and scatter, and that the corrected richness correlates well with X-ray luminosities and temperatures. We use the publicly available Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey shear catalogue to calibrate the mass-richness relation from stacked weak lensing analysis. Stacked weak lensing signals are detected significantly for eight subsamples of the SDSS clusters divided by redshift and richness bins, which are then compared with model predictions including miscentring effects to constrain mean halo masses of individual bins. We find the richness correlates well with the halo mass, such that the corrected richness limit of 20 corresponds to the cluster virial mass limit of about 1 {\texttimes} 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$} for the SDSS DR8 cluster sample.},

Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we show that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important systematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster mass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source galaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths of stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the source redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of the mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked lensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as well as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most significant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field surveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark energy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model systematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information improves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the cluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be constrained with a level of f\_NL{\textasciitilde}10. In this method, the mean source redshift is well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass in each bin to 5-10\% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the self-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.

We measure shapes of the DM haloes by strong gravitational lensing, whereas BCG shapes are derived from their light profiles in Hubble Space Telescope images. Our measurements from a large sample of massive clusters presented here provide new constraints on dark matter and cluster astrophysics. We find that DM haloes are on average highly elongated with the mean ellipticity of \$0.482{\textbackslash}pm 0.028\$, and position angles of major axes of DM haloes and their BCGs tend to be aligned well with the mean value of alignment angles of \$22.2{\textbackslash}pm 3.9\$ deg. We find that DM haloes in our sample are on average more elongated than their BCGs with the mean difference of their ellipticities of \$0.11{\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$. In contrast, the Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation predicts on average similar ellipticities between DM haloes and their central galaxies. While such a difference between the observations and the simulation may well be explained by the difference of their halo mass scales, other possibilities include the bias inherent to strong lensing measurements, limited knowledge of baryon physics, or a limitation of cold dark matter.},

We can use this merger sample to conduct studies on how mergers affect galaxy evolution. We use Zoobot, a deep learning representation learning model pre-trained on citizen science votes on Galaxy Zoo DeCALS images. We fine-tune Zoobot for the purpose of merger classification of images of SDSS and GAMA galaxies in HSC-SSP PDR 3. Fine-tuning is done using 1200 synthetic HSC-SSP images of galaxies from the TNG simulation. We then find merger probabilities on observed HSC images using the fine-tuned model. Using our merger probabilities, we examine the relationship between merger activity and environment. We find that our fine-tuned model returns an accuracy on the synthetic validation data of 76\%. This number is comparable to those of previous studies where convolutional neural networks were trained with simulation images, but with our work requiring a far smaller number of training samples. For our synthetic data, our model is able to achieve completeness and precision values of 80\%. In addition, our model is able to correctly classify both mergers and non-mergers of diverse morphologies and structures, including those at various stages and mass ratios, while distinguishing between projections and merger pairs. For the relation between galaxy mergers and environment, we find two distinct trends. Using stellar mass overdensity estimates for TNG simulations and observations using SDSS and GAMA, we find that galaxies with higher merger scores favor lower density environments on scales of 0.5 to 8 h{\textasciicircum}-1 Mpc. However, below these scales in the simulations, we find that galaxies with higher merger scores favor higher density environments.},

  abstract = {We present a fast methodology to produce mock observations of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects based on the dark matter only \$N\$-body simulations coupled with the analytic intra-cluster medium model. The methods employ two different approaches: halo-based pasting (HP) and particle-based pasting (PP). The former pastes gas density and pressure onto halos and requires only a halo catalogue, and the latter considers the contribution from field particles as well, i.e., particles that do not belong to any halos and thus utilise the full particle information. Therefore, the PP algorithm incorporates secondary effects beyond the HP algorithm: asphericity of halos and contribution from diffuse gas. In particular, such a diffuse component is the dominant source of the kinetic SZ effect. As validation of our methods, we have produced 108 all-sky maps with HP and 108 flat-sky maps, which cover \$5 {\textbackslash}times 5 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ with both HP and PP, and measured power spectra of the maps. Our method can produce a mock map within a few hours, even for all-sky coverage with a parallel computational environment. The power spectra of HP maps are consistent with the halo model prediction of the thermal SZ effect. On the other hand, the power spectra of PP maps are suppressed due to the halo asphericity but can reproduce better the theoretical prediction for the kinetic SZ effect. We discuss the utility of baryon-pasted mock SZ maps for estimating the covariance matrix of SZ statistics and modelling the selection and projection effects for cluster cosmology.},

We find that, when major axes of haloes are aligned with the line-of-sight direction, surface mass density profiles have higher amplitudes than those averaged over all halo orientations, over all scales from 0.1 to 100\,Mpc\,h-1 we studied. While the orientation dependence at small scales is ascribed to the halo triaxiality, our results indicate even stronger orientation dependence in the so-called two-halo regime, up to 100\,Mpc\,h-1. The orientation dependence for the two-halo term is well approximated by a multiplicative shift of the amplitude and therefore a shift in the halo bias parameter value. The halo bias from the two-halo term can be overestimated or underestimated by up to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \} 30{\textbackslash}hbox\{ per cent\}\$ depending on the viewing angle, which translates into the bias in estimated halo masses by up to a factor of 2 from halo bias measurements. The orientation dependence at large scales originates from the anisotropic halo--matter correlation function, which has an elliptical shape with the axis ratio of {$\sim$}0.55 up to 100\,Mpc\,h-1. We discuss potential impacts of halo orientation bias on other observables such as optically selected cluster samples and a clustering analysis of large-scale structure tracers such as quasars.},

In the latter phase, massive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z{$>$}3) outside of the virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are obtained from high-resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a full cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun h -1 lsimM vir {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 2.7 {\texttimes} 1013 M sun h -1 (h = 0.72) and central galaxy masses between 4.5 {\texttimes} 1010 M sun h -1 {$<$}{\textasciitilde} M * {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 3.6 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun h -1. The simulations include the effects of a uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation, and energetic feedback from Type II supernova. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and toward lower redshift. In our simulations, lower mass galaxies (M * {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 9 {\texttimes} 1010 M sun h -1) accrete about 60\% of their present-day stellar mass. High-mass galaxy (M * {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 1.7 {\texttimes} 1011 M sun h -1) assembly is dominated by accretion and merging with about 80\% of the stars added by the present day. In general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z = 1. For massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star formation. The majority of the in situ created stars are formed at z{$>$}2, primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of "archaeological downsizing," where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller structures; the galaxies themselves are assembled late.},

In this work, we reinvestigate the accuracy of the moving-mesh code AREPO and show how its convergence order can be improved for general problems. In particular, we clarify that for certain problems AREPO only reaches first-order convergence for its original formulation. This can be rectified by simple modifications we propose to the time integration scheme and the spatial gradient estimates of the code, both improving the accuracy of the code. We demonstrate that the new implementation is indeed second-order accurate under the L1 norm, and in particular substantially improves conservation of angular momentum. Interestingly, whereas these improvements can significantly change the results of smooth test problems, we also find that cosmological simulations of galaxy formation are unaffected, demonstrating that the numerical errors eliminated by the new formulation do not impact these simulations. In contrast, simulations of binary stars followed over a large number of orbital times are strongly affected, as here it is particularly crucial to avoid a long-term build up of errors in angular momentum conservation.},

In several papers, we introduce our MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project that provides a comprehensive set of high-resolution, large-volume simulations of cosmic structure formation aiming to better understand physical processes on large scales and to help interpret upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys. We here focus on the full physics box MTNG740 that computes a volume of \$740{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ with a baryonic mass resolution of \$3.1{\textbackslash}times {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ using AREPO with 80.6 billion cells and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We verify that the galaxy properties produced by MTNG740 are consistent with the TNG simulations, including more recent observations. We focus on galaxy clusters and analyse cluster scaling relations and radial profiles. We show that both are broadly consistent with various observational constraints. We demonstrate that the SZ-signal on a deep light-cone is consistent with Planck limits. Finally, we compare MTNG740 clusters with galaxy clusters found in Planck and the SDSS-8 RedMaPPer richness catalogue in observational space, finding very good agreement as well. However, simultaneously matching cluster masses, richness, and Compton-y requires us to assume that the SZ mass estimates for Planck clusters are underestimated by 0.2 dex on average. Due to its unprecedented volume for a high-resolution hydrodynamical calculation, the MTNG740 simulation offers rich possibilities to study baryons in galaxies, galaxy clusters, and in large-scale structure, and in particular their impact on upcoming large cosmological surveys.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are known to be dynamically important in the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in the haloes of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic fields have typically been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global influence on galaxy formation largely unclear. Here we extend our magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) implementation in the moving-mesh code AREPO to cosmological problems which include radiative cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell eight-wave scheme, which turns out to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the magneto-rotational instability in accretion discs, which reproduce the correct linear growth rate of the instability. Using this new MHD code, we simulate the formation of isolated disc galaxies similar to the Milky Way using idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the magnetic field strength is quickly amplified in the initial central starburst and the differential rotation of the forming disc, eventually reaching a saturation value. At this point, the magnetic field pressure in the interstellar medium becomes comparable to the thermal pressure, and a further efficient growth of the magnetic field strength is prevented. The additional pressure component leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations without magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of the gas disc. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflows from the disc. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are largely independent of the initial magnetic seed field strength assumed in the initial conditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. Our findings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formation and evolution, cautioning against their neglect in theoretical models of structure formation.},

  abstract = {We constrain cosmological parameters and galaxy-bias parameters using the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) year-3 data. We describe our modeling framework and choice of scales analyzed, validating their robustness to theoretical uncertainties in small-scale clustering by analyzing simulated data. Using a linear galaxy-bias model and redMaGiC galaxy sample, we obtain 10\% constraints on the matter density of the Universe. We also implement a nonlinear galaxy-bias model to probe smaller scales that includes parametrization based on hybrid perturbation theory and find that it leads to a 17\% gain in cosmological constraining power. We perform robustness tests of our methodology pipeline and demonstrate stability of the constraints to changes in the theory model. Using the redMaGiC galaxy sample as foreground lens galaxies and adopting the best-fitting cosmological parameters from DES year-1 data, we find the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to exhibit significant signals akin to decorrelation between galaxies and mass on large scales, which is not expected in any current models. This likely systematic measurement error biases our constraints on galaxy bias and the S8 parameter. We find that a scale-, redshift- and sky-area-independent phenomenological decorrelation parameter can effectively capture this inconsistency between the galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We trace the source of this correlation to a color-dependent photometric issue and minimize its impact on our result by changing the selection criteria of redMaGiC galaxies. Using this new sample, our constraints on the S8 parameter are consistent with previous studies and we find a small shift in the {\textohm}m constraints compared to the fiducial redMaGiC sample. We infer the constraints on the mean host-halo mass of the redMaGiC galaxies in this new sample from the large-scale bias constraints, finding the galaxies occupy halos of mass approximately 1.6 {\texttimes}1013 M{$\odot$}/h .},

This is explained in zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by the fact that these galaxies are forming in cosmic web filaments where accretion happens preferentially along the direction of elongation. We ask whether the elongated morphology of these galaxies allows them to be used as effective tracers of cosmic web filaments at high redshift via their intrinsic alignments. Using mock light cones and spectroscopically confirmed galaxy pairs from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), we test two types of alignments: (1) between the galaxy major axis and the direction to nearby galaxies of any mass and (2) between the major axes of nearby pairs of low-mass, likely prolate, galaxies. The mock light cones predict strong signals in 3D real space, 3D redshift space, and 2D projected redshift space for both types of alignments (assuming prolate galaxy orientations are the same as those of their host prolate haloes), but we do not detect significant alignment signals in CANDELS observations. However, we show that spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for only a small fraction of highly elongated galaxies, and accounting for spectroscopic incompleteness and redshift errors significantly degrades the 2D mock signal. This may partly explain the alignment discrepancy and highlights one of several avenues for future work.},

We build a differentiable Bayesian model and use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to efficiently and robustly infer the 3D shapes of star-forming galaxies in JWST-CEERS observations with \${\textbackslash}log M\_*/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}=9.0-10.5\$ at \$z=0.5-8.0\$. We reproduce previous results from HST-CANDELS in a fraction of the computing time and constrain the mean ellipticity, triaxiality, size and covariances with samples as small as \${\textbackslash}sim50\$ galaxies. We find high 3D ellipticities for all mass-redshift bins suggesting oblate (disky) or prolate (elongated) geometries. We break that degeneracy by constraining the mean triaxiality to be \${\textbackslash}sim1\$ for \${\textbackslash}log M\_*/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}=9.0-9.5\$ dwarfs at \$z{$>$}1\$ (favoring the prolate scenario), with significantly lower triaxialities for higher masses and lower redshifts indicating the emergence of disks. The prolate population traces out a ``banana'' in the projected \$b/a-{\textbackslash}log a\$ diagram with an excess of low \$b/a\$, large \${\textbackslash}log a\$ galaxies. The dwarf prolate fraction rises from \${\textbackslash}sim25{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$z=0.5-1.0\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim50-80{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$z=3-8\$. If these are disks, they cannot be axisymmetric but instead must be unusually oval (triaxial) unlike local circular disks. We simultaneously constrain the 3D size-mass relation and its dependence on 3D geometry. High-probability prolate and oblate candidates show remarkably similar S{\'e}rsic indices (\$n{\textbackslash}sim1\$), non-parametric morphological properties and specific star formation rates. Both tend to be visually classified as disks or irregular but edge-on oblate candidates show more dust attenuation. We discuss selection effects, follow-up prospects and theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {As imaging surveys progress in exploring the large-scale structure of the Universe through the use of weak gravitational lensing, achieving sub-per cent accuracy in estimating shape distortions caused by lensing, or shear, is imperative for precision cosmology. In this paper, we extend the Fourier power function shapelets (FPFS) shear estimator using fourth-order shapelet moments and combine it with the original second-order shear estimator to reduce galaxy shape noise. We calibrate this novel shear estimator analytically to a sub-per cent level-accuracy using the AnaCal framework. This higher order shear estimator is tested with realistic image simulations, and after analytical correction for the detection/selection bias and noise bias, the multiplicative shear bias \${\textbar}m{\textbar}\$ is below \$3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ (99.7 per cent confidence interval) for both isolated and blended galaxies. Once combined with the second-order FPFS shear estimator, the shape noise is reduced by \${\textbackslash}sim 35{\textasciitilde}\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ for isolated galaxies in simulations with Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time observational conditions. However, for blended galaxies, the effective number density does not significantly improve with the combination of the two estimators. Based on these results, we recommend exploration of how this framework can further reduce the systematic uncertainties in shear due to point spread function leakage and modelling error, and potentially provide improved precision in shear inference in high-resolution space-based images.},

Our analysis notably includes an empirical model for the anisotropic boosts impacting the lensing and clustering signals of optical clusters. These boosts arise from a preferential selection of clusters surrounded by anisotropic large scale structure, a consequence of the limited discrimination between line-of-sight interlopers and true cluster members offered by photometric surveys. We validate our analysis via a blind cosmology challenge on mocks, and find that we can obtain tight and unbiased cosmological constraints without informative priors or external calibrations on any of our model parameters. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters, and find results favoring low \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\$ and high \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, combining to yield the lensing strength constraint \$S\_8 = 0.718\_\{-0.015\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.016\}\$. We investigate potential drivers behind these results through a series of post-unblinding tests, noting that our results are consistent with existing cluster cosmology constraints but clearly inconsistent with other CMB/LSS based cosmology results. From these tests, we find hints that a suppression in the cluster lensing signal may be driving our results.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations have been used to study interacting galaxies as a function of galaxy pair separation, enabling comparisons with observational studies of galaxy pairs. The study of interacting galaxies as a function of time (i.e. merger stage) has mostly been limited to high resolution merger simulations, due to the poor time sampling available in cosmological simulations. Building on an earlier study of galaxy pairs in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we reconstruct the orbits of galaxy pairs involving massive galaxies (\$M\_* {$>$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) at redshifts of \$0 {\textbackslash}leq z {$<$} 1\$, using a novel kinematic interpolation scheme to model the orbits in between the IllustrisTNG snapshots (which are separated by 162 Myr on average). We assess the accuracy of these interpolations using a pre-existing suite of merger simulations, and find that kinematic interpolations provide a remarkable improvement in accuracy compared with interpolations that use only radial separations or 3D positions. We find that nearly 90 per cent of the closest pairs (\$r {$<$} 25\$ kpc) have had a pericentre encounter within the past Gyr. Many of these close pairs are found on rapidly shrinking orbits, and roughly 85 per cent of these pairs will merge within 1 Gyr. However, approximately 3 per cent of these close pairs appear to be flyby systems that will never merge. These reconstructed orbits will be used in future studies to investigate how and when galaxy properties change during close encounters and mergers between galaxies in IllustrisTNG.},

Inferring correct values and accurate uncertainties of cosmological parameters requires accurate knowledge of cluster abundance statistics, encoded in the likelihood function. In this paper, we test the accuracy of cluster abundance likelihoods used in the literature, namely the Poisson and Gaussian likelihoods as well as the more complete description of the Gauss-Poisson Compound likelihood. This is repeated for a variety of binning choices and analysis setups. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a given likelihood, this work compares individual posterior covariances to the covariance of estimators over the 1000 simulated dark matter halo catalogues obtained from PINOCCHIO algorithm. We find that for Rubin/LSST and Euclid-like surveys the Gaussian likelihood gives robust constraints over a large range of binning choices. The Poisson likelihood, that does not account for sample covariance, always underestimates the errors on the parameters, even when the sample volume is reduced or only high-mass clusters are considered. We find no benefit in using the more complex Gauss-Poisson Compound likelihood as it gives essentially the same results as the Gaussian likelihood, but at a greater computational cost. Finally, in this ideal setup, we note only a small gain on the parameter error bars when using a large number of bins in the mass-redshift plane.},

Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant {$\Lambda$}. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lema{\^i}tre model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein--de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.

  abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z {\textasciitilde} 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30\%-70\% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and {$\alpha$}s for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by {$\Delta\alpha$}s {\textasciitilde} 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and {$\alpha$}s as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making {$\alpha$}s slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative {$\alpha$}-element abundances.

We tabulated their publications at the point where fellowship applications were submitted, and we find that the 133 fellowship recipients in that time frame had a median of 6 +/- 2 first-author publications, and 14 +/- 6 co-authored publications. The full range of first author papers is 1 to 15, and for all papers ranges from 2 to 76, indicating very diverse publication patterns. Thus, while fellowship recipients generally have strong publication records, the distribution of both first-author and co-authored papers is quite broad; there is no apparent threshold of publications necessary to obtain these fellowships. We also examined the post-PhD publication rates for each of the three fellowship programs, between male and female recipients, across the four years of the analysis and find no consistent trends. We hope that these findings will prove a useful reference to future junior scientists.},

For the first time, we are able to perform a calibration of {$\mu\star$} at high redshifts, z {$>$} 0.33. In a blinded analysis, we use {\textasciitilde}6000 clusters split into 12 subsets spanning the ranges 0.1 {$\leq$} z {$<$} 0.65 and {$\mu\star$} up to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\} 5.5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, and infer the average masses of these subsets through modelling of their stacked weak-lensing signal. In our model, we account for the following sources of systematic uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors, miscentring, cluster-member contamination of the source sample, deviations from the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We use the inferred masses to estimate the joint mass-{$\mu\star$}-z scaling relation given by \${\textbackslash}langle M\_\{200c\} {\textbar} {\textbackslash}mu \_\{{\textbackslash}star \},z {\textbackslash}rangle = M\_0 ({\textbackslash}mu \_\{{\textbackslash}star \}/5.16{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}){\textasciicircum}\{F\_\{{\textbackslash}mu \_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\}\} ((1+z)/1.35){\textasciicircum}\{G\_z\}\$.

Divergence estimation is typically solved estimating the densities first. Our main result shows this intermediate step is unnecessary and that the divergence can be either estimated using the empirical cdf or k-nearest-neighbour density estimation, which does not converge to the true measure for finite k. The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

  abstract = {It has recently been suggested that a gravitational transition of the effective Newton's constant \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ by about 10\%, taking place 50-150 Myrs ago, can lead to the resolution of both the Hubble crisis and the growth tension of the standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Hints for such an abrupt transition with weaker gravity at times before the transition, have recently been identified in Tully Fisher galactic mass-velocity data and also in Cepheid SnIa calibrator data. Here we use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that such a transition could significantly increase (by a factor of 3 or more) the number of long period comets (LPCs) impacting the solar system from the Oort cloud (semi-major axis of orbits \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}4AU\$). This increase is consistent with observational evidence from the terrestrial and lunar cratering rates indicating that the impact flux of kilometer sized objects increased by at least a factor of 2 over that last 100 Myrs compared to the long term average. This increase may also be connected with the Chicxulub impactor event that produced the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction of 75\% of life on Earth (including dinosaurs) about 66 Myrs ago. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that for isotropic Oort cloud comet distribution with initially circular orbits, random velocity perturbations (induced eg by passing stars and/or galactic tidal effects), lead to a deformation of the orbits that increases significantly when \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ increases. A 10\% increase of \$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ leads to an increase in the probability of the comets to enter the loss cone and reach the planetary region (pericenter of less than 10AU) by a factor that ranges from 5\% (for velocity perturbation much smaller than the comet initial velocity) to more than 300\% (for total velocity perturbations comparable with the initial comet velocity).},

The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 {\texttimes} 1014 M{$\odot$} have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( - 3.5 {$\lessequivlnt$} {$\alpha$}3D {$\lessequivlnt$} -3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as {$\propto$}(M500c)0.49 with a {$\sim$}0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011 M{$\odot$} in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight ({$\sim$}0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with r{\textasciicircum}stars\_0.5 {$\propto$} (M\_200c){\textasciicircum}\{0.53\}. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h-1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012 M{$\odot$} haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.},

  abstract = {This study examines the average X-ray properties of massive halos at z{$<$} 0.2, covering the largest halo mass range to date, from Milky Way-like halos to massive clusters. The analysis is based on stacking in the eFEDS area of the GAMA galaxy group sample, validated with synthetic data that mimic observed eROSITA X-ray and GAMA optical data using Magneticum lightcones. Stacking was conducted in halo mass bins and tested for AGN and X-ray binary contamination, systematics in the halo mass proxy, and uncertainties in optical group centers. The study provides average X-ray surface brightness profiles in six mass bins, spanning Milky Way-like systems to poor clusters. The scatter in the X-ray luminosity-mass (LX-M) relation is attributed to gas concentration: low X-ray luminosity systems at fixed halo mass exhibit lower central gas concentrations than high-luminosity systems, consistent with Magneticum predictions. However, discrepancies in dark matter concentration arise, with Magneticum predicting undetected groups as older and more relaxed, while observations suggest the opposite. New LX-M relations are presented covering three decades of halo mass. These relations fit a single power law, aligning with previous studies. Magneticum matches observed gas distributions across all masses, whereas IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, Simba, and FLAMINGO exhibit significant discrepancies at various mass scales. Simulations calibrated on local galaxy properties accurately reproduce central galaxies but fail to capture gas properties. Conversely, simulations like Magneticum excel in gas predictions but produce overly massive central galaxies. Further exploration of gas and dark matter distributions and their effects on galaxy properties is critical to comprehending the role of gravitational forces and feedback in shaping large-scale structure and galaxy evolution.},

  abstract = {By using eROSITA data in the eFEDS area, we provide a measure of the hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation over the largest halo mass range, from Milky Way-sized halos to massive clusters, and to the largest radii ever probed so far in local systems. To cope with the incompleteness and selection biases of the X-ray selection, we apply the stacking technique in eROSITA data of a highly complete and tested sample of optically selected groups. The method has been extensively tested on mock observations. In massive clusters, the hot gas alone provides a baryon budget within \$R\_\{200\}\$ consistent with the cosmic value. At the same time, at the group mass scale, it accounts only for 20-40\% of it. The hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation is well-fitted by a power law, with a consistent shape and a normalization varying at maximum by a factor of 2 from \$r\_\{500\}\$ to \$r\_\{200\}\$. Such a relation is consistent with other works in the literature that consider X-ray survey data at the same depth as eFEDS. However, it provides a lower average gas fraction in the group regime than works based on X-ray bright group samples. The comparison of the observed relation with the predictions of several hydrodynamical simulations (BAHAMAS, FLAMINGO, SIMBA, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, and Magneticum) shows that all simulations but Magneticum and SIMBA overpredict the gas fraction, with the largest discrepancy (up to a factor of 3) in the massive group-poor cluster halo mass range. We emphasize the need for mechanisms that can effectively expel gas to larger radii in galaxy groups without excessively quenching star formation in their member galaxies. Current hydrodynamical simulations face a significant challenge in balancing their subgrid physics: none can sufficiently evacuate gas from the halo virial region without negatively impacting the properties of the resident galaxy population.},

  abstract = {The paper presents the analysis of optically selected GAMA groups and clusters in the SRG/eROSITA X-ray map of eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey, in the halo mass range 1013-5 {\texttimes} 1014 M{$\odot$} and at z {$<$} 0.2. All X-ray detections have a clear GAMA counterpart, but most of the GAMA groups in the halo mass range 1013-1014 M{$\odot$} remain undetected. We compare the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the eROSITA detected groups with the mean stacked profile of the undetected low-mass haloes at fixed halo mass. Overall, we find that the undetected groups exhibit less concentrated X-ray surface brightness, dark matter, and galaxy distributions with respect to the X-ray-detected haloes. The mean gas mass fraction profiles are consistent in the two samples within 1.5{$\sigma$}, indicating that the gas follows the dark matter profile. The low-mass concentration and the magnitude gap indicate that these systems are young. They reside with a higher probability in filaments while X-ray-detected groups favour the nodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the lower central emission, the undetected systems tend to be X-ray underluminous at fixed halo mass and to lie below the LX-Mhalo relation. Interestingly, the X-ray-detected systems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while those in filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relationship between the system X-ray appearance and the active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. We cannot exclude the role of the past AGN feedback in affecting the gas distribution over the halo lifetime. However, the data suggests that the observed differences might be related to the halo assembly bias.},

At densities greater than about 3000 galaxies/cu Mpc, the fraction of elliptical galaxies rises steeply.

This is the second paper in a two-part series aimed at measuring a KL signal from data. The first paper, arXiv:2209.11811, describes the inference pipeline, which jointly forward models galaxy imaging and spectroscopy, and demonstrates unbiased shear inference with simulated data. This paper presents measurements of the lensing signal from the galaxy cluster Abell 2261. We obtain spectroscopic observations of background disk galaxies in the cluster field selected from the CLASH Subaru catalog. The final sample consists of three source galaxies while the remaining are rejected due to insufficient signal-to-noise, spectroscopic failures, and inadequately sampled rotation curves. We apply the KL inference pipeline to the three sources and find the shear estimates to be in broad agreement with traditional weak lensing measurements. The typical shear measurement uncertainty for our sources is \${\textbackslash}sigma(g\_+){\textbackslash}approx 0.026\$, which represents approximately a ten-fold improvement over the weak lensing shape noise. We identify target selection and observing strategy as the key avenues of improvement for future KL programs.},

  abstract = {The total mass of a galaxy cluster is one of its most fundamental properties. Together with the redshift, the mass links observation and theory, allowing us to use the cluster population to test models of structure formation and to constrain cosmological parameters. Building on the rich heritage from X-ray surveys, new results from Sunyaev-Zeldovich and optical surveys have stimulated a resurgence of interest in cluster cosmology. These studies have generally found fewer clusters than predicted by the baseline Planck {$\Lambda$}CDM model, prompting a renewed effort on the part of the community to obtain a definitive measure of the true cluster mass scale. Here we review recent progress on this front. Our theoretical understanding continues to advance, with numerical simulations being the cornerstone of this effort. On the observational side, new, sophisticated techniques are being deployed in individual mass measurements and to account for selection biases in cluster surveys. We summarise the state of the art in cluster mass estimation methods and the systematic uncertainties and biases inherent in each approach, which are now well identified and understood, and explore how current uncertainties propagate into the cosmological parameter analysis. We discuss the prospects for improvements to the measurement of the mass scale using upcoming multi-wavelength data, and the future use of the cluster population as a cosmological probe.},

  abstract = {eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) is the primary instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, which was successfully launched on July 13, 2019, from the Baikonour cosmodrome. After the commissioning of the instrument and a subsequent calibration and performance verification phase, eROSITA started a survey of the entire sky on December 13, 2019. By the end of 2023, eight complete scans of the celestial sphere will have been performed, each lasting six months. At the end of this program, the eROSITA all-sky survey in the soft X-ray band (0.2-2.3 keV) will be about 25 times more sensitive than the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, while in the hard band (2.3-8 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky. The eROSITA design driving science is the detection of large samples of galaxy clusters up to redshifts z {$>$} 1 in order to study the large-scale structure of the universe and test cosmological models including Dark Energy. In addition, eROSITA is expected to yield a sample of a few million AGNs, including obscured objects, revolutionizing our view of the evolution of supermassive black holes. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including X-ray binaries, active stars, and diffuse emission within the Galaxy. Results from early observations, some of which are presented here, confirm that the performance of the instrument is able to fulfil its scientific promise. With this paper, we aim to give a concise description of the instrument, its performance as measured on ground, its operation in space, and also the first results from in-orbit measurements.},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

  abstract = {We present a new method to estimate shear measurement bias in image simulations that significantly improves the precision with respect to current techniques. Our method is based on measuring the shear response for individual images. We generated sheared versions of the same image to measure how the galaxy shape changes with the small applied shear. This shear response is the multiplicative shear bias for each image. In addition, we also measured the individual additive bias. Using the same noise realizations for each sheared version allows us to compute the shear response at very high precision. The estimated shear bias of a sample of galaxies is then the average of the individual measurements. The precision of this method leads to an improvement with respect to previous methods concerned with the precision of estimates of multiplicative bias since our method is not affected by noise from shape measurements, which until now has been the dominant uncertainty. As a consequence, the method does not require shape-noise suppression for a precise estimation of shear multiplicative bias. Our method can be readily used for numerous applications such as shear measurement validation and calibration, reducing the number of necessary simulated images by a few orders of magnitude to achieve the same precision.},

This is not totally surprising as, according to the peak-background split model, local matter density (bar {$\delta$}) is the property that constrains bias at large scales. Massive haloes have a high clustering because they reside in high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of environments which differentially determine their clustering amplitudes. This contradicts the assumption made by standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models that bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their mass. We show that the bias of central galaxies from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation as a function of luminosity and colour is therefore not correctly predicted by the standard HOD model. Using bar {$\delta$} (of matter or galaxies) instead of halo mass, the HOD model correctly predicts galaxy bias. These results indicate the need to include information about local density and not only mass in order to correctly apply HOD analysis in these galaxy samples. This new model can be readily applied to observations and has the advantage that, in contrast with the dark matter halo mass, the galaxy density can be directly observed.},

  abstract = {Context. Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are found to follow a wide variety of merger and accretion histories in cosmological simulations. Aims: We characterize the photometric and kinematic properties of simulated ETG stellar halos, and compare them to the observations. Methods: We selected a sample of 1114 ETGs in the TNG100 simulation and 80 in the higher-resolution TNG50. These ETGs span a stellar mass range of 1010.3 - 1012 M{$\odot$} and they were selected within the range of g - r colour and {$\lambda$}-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs. We determined photometric parameters, intrinsic shapes, and kinematic observables in their extended stellar halos. We compared the results with central IFU kinematics and ePN.S planetary nebula velocity fields at large radii, studying the variation in kinematics from center to halo, and connecting it to a change in the intrinsic shape of the galaxies. Results: We find that the simulated galaxy sample reproduces the diversity of kinematic properties observed in ETG halos. Simulated fast rotators (FRs) divide almost evenly in one third having flat {$\lambda$} profiles and high halo rotational support, a third with gently decreasing profiles, and another third with low halo rotation. However, the peak of rotation occurs at larger R than in observed ETG samples. Slow rotators (SRs) tend to have increased rotation in the outskirts, with half of them exceeding {$\lambda$} = 0.2. For M* {$>$} 1011.5 M{$\odot$} halo rotation is unimportant. A similar variety of properties is found for the stellar halo intrinsic shapes. Rotational support and shape are deeply related: the kinematic transition to lower rotational support is accompanied by a change towards rounder intrinsic shape. Triaxiality in the halos of FRs increases outwards and with stellar mass. Simulated SRs have relatively constant triaxiality profiles. Conclusions: Simulated stellar halos show a large variety of structural properties, with quantitative but no clear qualitative differences between FRs and SRs. At the same stellar mass, stellar halo properties show a more gradual transition and significant overlap between the two families, despite the clear bimodality in the central regions. This is in agreement with observations of extended photometry and kinematics.},

The SPT observations combine data from the previous and current surveys, namely SPTpol and SPT-3G, to achieve depths of 4.5, 3, and 16 \${\textbackslash}mu \{{\textbackslash}rm K-arcmin\}\$ in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. For SPIRE, we include data from the 600 and 857 GHz bands. We reconstruct the velocity-induced large-scale correlation of the small-scale kSZ signal with a quadratic estimator that uses two cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps, constructed by optimally combining data from all the frequency bands. We reject the null hypothesis of a zero trispectrum at \$10.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. However, the measured trispectrum contains contributions from both the kSZ and other undesired components, such as CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds, with kSZ being sub-dominant. We use the {\textbackslash}textsc\{Agora\} simulations to estimate the expected signal from CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds. After accounting for the contributions from CMB lensing and foreground signals, we do not detect an excess kSZ-only trispectrum and use this non-detection to set constraints on reionization. By applying a prior based on observations of the Gunn-Peterson trough, we obtain an upper limit on the duration of reionization of \${\textbackslash}Delta z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm re, 50\} {$<$} 4.5\$ (95{\textbackslash}\% C.L). We find these constraints are fairly robust to foregrounds assumptions. This trispectrum measurement is independent of, but consistent with, \{{\textbackslash}it Planck\}'s optical depth measurement. This result is the first constraint on the epoch of reionization using the non-Gaussian nature of the kSZ signal.},

  abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of \$0.20 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

  abstract = {Context. Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool for accessing the full distribution of dark matter on the sky, but because of intrinsic galaxy ellipticies, finite fields, and missing data, the recovery of dark matter maps constitutes a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem Aims: We introduce a novel methodology that enables the efficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak lensing mass-mapping problem, relying on simulations to define a fully non-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method to simulated fields, and then proceed to apply it to the mass reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field. Methods: The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian statistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of deep generative models based on neural score matching. This approach allows us to make full use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the solution, to understand any differences between this analytic prior and full simulations from cosmological simulations, and to obtain samples from the full Bayesian posterior of the problem for robust uncertainty quantification. Results: We demonstrate the method in the {$\kappa$}TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean significantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter, Sparsity priors) both for the root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson correlation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered posterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence values and the S/N of the clusters artificially introduced into a field. Finally, we apply the method to the reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field, which yields the highest-quality convergence map of this field to date. Conclusions: We find the proposed approach to be superior to previous algorithms, scalable, providing uncertainties, and using a fully non-Gaussian prior.

We find that this version of the SAM does not agree well with the current data for stellar mass-only lenses with \$M\_{\textbackslash}ast 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. By decreasing the merger time for satellite galaxies as well as reducing the radio-mode active galactic nucleus accretion efficiency in the SAM, we obtain better agreement, both for the lensing and the clustering, at the high-mass end. We show that the new model is consistent with the signals for central galaxies presented in Velliscig et al. Turning to the hydrodynamical simulation, TNG300 produces good lensing predictions, both for stellar mass-only ({$\chi$}2 = 1.81 compared to {$\chi$}2 = 7.79 for the SAM) and locally brightest galaxy samples ({$\chi$}2 = 3.80 compared to {$\chi$}2 = 5.01). With added dust corrections to the colours it matches the SDSS clustering signal well for red low-mass galaxies.

We compare the SBI parameter posterior samples to those from an MCMC analysis that uses the same analytical models to construct predictions of the observed data vector. The two methods exhibit comparable performance, with reliable constraints derived for the primary cosmological parameters, (\${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$), and richness-mass relation parameters. We also perform out-of-domain tests with observables constructed from galaxy cluster-sized halos in the Quijote simulations. Again, the SBI and MCMC results have comparable posteriors, with similar uncertainties and biases. Unsurprisingly, upon evaluating the SBI method on thousands of simulated data vectors that span the parameter space, SBI exhibits worsened posterior calibration metrics in the out-of-domain application. We note that such calibration tests with MCMC is less computationally feasible and highlight the potential use of SBI to stress-test limitations of analytical models, such as in the use for constructing models for inference with MCMC.},

Using data generated from the Quijote simulation suite and analytical models, we train a machine learning algorithm to learn the probability function between cosmological parameters and the possible galaxy cluster observables. The posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters at a given observation is then obtained by sampling the predictions from the trained algorithm. Our results show that the SBI method can successfully recover the truth values of the cosmological parameters within the 2\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} limit for this simplified galaxy cluster analysis, and acquires similar posterior constraints obtained with a likelihood-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the current state-of the-art method used in similar cosmological studies.},

These programs are likely to shape the course of high redshift investigations for the 2020s. NIRCam will be used to image over 200 square arc minutes using a suite of seven wide filters and two medium width filters to create an imaging dataset used for multiple goals including derivation of luminosity functions beyond the current redshift frontier, the early evolution of galaxy morphologies, discovery of the first quenched galaxies, stellar mass buildup in the first billion years, study of morphologies versus redshift, estimation of photometric redshifts, and selection of objects for spectroscopy with NIRSpec. Spectra of several thousand galaxies from the NIRSpec portion of the program will enable studies such as measuring chemical enrichment and the build-up of stellar mass with redshift, disappearance of Lyman- during reionization, and the role of feedback in shaping the evolution of galaxies. We hope to increase the value of our survey to the community early in the decade and in the scientific life of JWST by releasing some imaging and spectroscopic data prior to the end of the JADES proprietary period.},

  abstract = {We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris simulation by directly tracking the baryonic content of subhaloes. These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as {$\sim$}(1 + z)2.4-2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than {$\sim$}2 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$}. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$}), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1011 M{$\odot$}), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

Most of our synthetic images were created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and performing the radiative transfer directly on the Voronoi mesh used by the simulations themselves. We have analysed both our synthetic and real Pan-STARRS images with the newly developed statmorph code, which calculates non-parametric morphological diagnostics - including the Gini-M20 and concentration-asymmetry-smoothness statistics - and performs 2D S{\'e}rsic fits. Overall, we find that the optical morphologies of IllustrisTNG galaxies are in good agreement with observations, and represent a substantial improvement compared to the original Illustris simulation. In particular, the locus of the Gini-M20 diagram is consistent with that inferred from observations, while the median trends with stellar mass of all the morphological, size and shape parameters considered in this work lie within the {$\sim$}1{$\sigma$} scatter of the observational trends. However, the IllustrisTNG model has some difficulty with more stringent tests, such as producing a strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a somewhat higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to observations. Similarly, the morphology-size relation is problematic: while observations show that discs tend to be larger than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a trend is not present in IllustrisTNG.},

  abstract = {We use the Illustris simulation to study the relative contributions of in situ star formation and stellar accretion to the build-up of galaxies over an unprecedentedly wide range of masses (M* = 109-1012 M{$\odot$}), galaxy types, environments, and assembly histories. We find that the `two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation - namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times 1011 M{$\odot$} is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at z = 0 contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10 per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for M* {$\approx$} 1012 M{$\odot$} objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the centres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than disc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. On average, {$\sim$}50 per cent of the ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio {$\mu$} {$>$} 1/4), {$\sim$}20 per cent from minor mergers (1/10 {$<$} {$\mu$} {$<$} 1/4), {$\sim$}20 per cent from very minor mergers ({$\mu$} {$<$} 1/10), and {$\sim$}10 per cent from stars that were stripped from surviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers). These components are spatially segregated, with in situ stars dominating the innermost regions of galaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited at larger galactocentric distances in order of decreasing merger mass ratio.},

We use two independent methods: A modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and the angle between the central galaxy orientation and the satellite galaxies relative position. The first method allows us to study the inner and outer regions of the cluster, while the second method provides information within the halos. Our results show that central galaxies present anysotropy in the correlation function up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}Mpc\$, which becomes \${\textbackslash}sim\$10{\textbackslash}\% stronger for the brightest ones (\${\textasciicircum}\{0.1\}M\_\{r\}{$<$}-21.5\$). When we split the galaxy sample by colour, we find that red central galaxies are the main contributors to this anisotropy. We also show that this behaviour does not depend on the group mass or central galaxy ellipticity. Finally, our results are in agreement with previous findings, showing that the two-point cross-correlation function is a best tracer of the galaxy alignments using all galaxies and not only those of the group to which it belongs. In addition, this feature allows us to explore the behaviour of the alignment on larger scales.},

We find tensions driven mainly by two factors: (i) systematic differences in the X-ray cluster observables used to derive the scaling relations and (ii) uncertainty in the modelling of how the gas mass of galaxy clusters scales with total mass. All scaling relations are in agreement after accounting for these two effects. We describe a multivariate scaling model that enables a fully self-consistent treatment of multiple observational catalogues in the presence of property covariance and apply this formalism when interpreting published results. The corrections due to scatter and observable covariance can be significant. For instance, our predicted YSZ-LX scaling relation differs from that derived using the naive `plug in' method by {$\approx$}25\,per\,cent. Finally, we test the mass normalization for each of the X-ray data sets we consider by applying a space density consistency test: we compare the observed ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-ray (REFLEX) luminosity function to expectations from published LX--M relations convolved with the mass function for a Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model.},

Our constraints are fully consistent with the WMAP five-year data, and in a joint analysis we find {\textbackslash}sigma\_8=0.807{\textbackslash}pm 0.020 and {\textbackslash}Omega\_m=0.265{\textbackslash}pm 0.016, an improvement of nearly a factor of two relative to WMAP5 alone.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to study the impact of various sources of observational scatter on this relation. Cluster ellipticity, photometric errors, photometric redshift errors, and cluster-to-cluster variations in the properties of red-sequence galaxies contribute negligible noise. Miscentering, however, can be important, and likely contributes to the scatter in the richness-mass relation of galaxy maxBCG clusters at the low-mass end, where centering is more difficult. We also investigate the impact of projection effects under several empirically motivated assumptions about cluster environments. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and the maxBCG cluster catalog, we demonstrate that variations in cluster environments can rarely ({$\approx$}1\%-5\% of the time) result in significant richness boosts. Due to the steepness of the mass/richness function, the corresponding fraction of optically selected clusters that suffer from these projection effects is {$\approx$}5\%-15\%. We expect these numbers to be generic in magnitude, but a precise determination requires detailed, survey-specific modeling.},

These improvements are largely due to the better treatment of galaxy color data. We also demonstrate the scatter in the LX -richness relation depends on the aperture used to estimate cluster richness, and introduce a novel approach for optimizing said aperture which can easily be generalized to other mass tracers.},

The algorithm was specifically developed to minimize photometric redshift uncertainties in photometric large-scale structure studies. redMaGiC achieves this by self-training the colour cuts necessary to produce a luminosity-thresholded LRG sample of constant comoving density. We demonstrate that redMaGiC photo-zs are very nearly as accurate as the best machine learning-based methods, yet they require minimal spectroscopic training, do not suffer from extrapolation biases, and are very nearly Gaussian. We apply our algorithm to Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data to produce a redMaGiC catalogue sampling the redshift range z {$\in$} [0.2, 0.8]. Our fiducial sample has a comoving space density of 10-3\,(h-1\,Mpc)-3, and a median photo-z bias (zspec - zphoto) and scatter ({$\sigma$}z/(1 + z)) of 0.005 and 0.017, respectively. The corresponding 5{$\sigma$} outlier fraction is 1.4~per~cent. We also test our algorithm with Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and Stripe 82 data, and discuss how spectroscopic training can be used to control photo-z biases at the 0.1~per~cent level.},

These common clusters define a tight scaling relation in the richness-SZ mass (\${\textbackslash}lambda\$--\$M\_\{SZ\}\$) plane, with an intrinsic scatter in richness of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}lambda{\textbar}M\_\{SZ\}\} = 0.266 {\textbackslash}pm 0.017\$. The corresponding intrinsic scatter in true cluster halo mass at fixed richness is \${\textbackslash}approx 21{\textbackslash}\%\$. The regularity of this scaling relation is used to identify failures in both the redMaPPer and Planck cluster catalogs. Of the 245 galaxy clusters in common, we identify three failures in redMaPPer and 36 failures in the PSZ1. Of these, at least 12 are due to clusters whose optical counterpart was correctly identified in the PSZ1, but where the quoted redshift for the optical counterpart in the external data base used in the PSZ1 was incorrect. The failure rates for redMaPPer and the PSZ1 are \$1.2{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$14.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ respectively, or 9.8\% in the PSZ1 after subtracting the external data base errors. We have further identified 5 PSZ1 sources that suffer from projection effects (multiple rich systems along the line-of-sight of the SZ detection) and 17 new high redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.6\$) cluster candidates of varying degrees of confidence. Should all of the high-redshift cluster candidates identified here be confirmed, we will have tripled the number of high redshift Planck clusters in the SDSS region. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength observations to identify and characterize systematic errors in galaxy cluster data sets, and clearly establish photometric data both as a robust cluster finding method, and as an important part of defining clean galaxy cluster samples.},

The redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm treats this problem probabilistically. Here, we utilize SDSS and GAMA spectroscopic membership rates to validate the redMaPPer membership probability estimates for clusters with \$z{\textbackslash}in[0.1,0.3]\$. We find small - but correctable - biases, sourced by three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we find exquisite agreement (\${\textbackslash}approx 1{\textbackslash}\%\$) between the photometric probability estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection effects from correlated structure contribute \${\textbackslash}approx 6{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the richness of a redMaPPer galaxy cluster.

  abstract = {When extracting the weak lensing shear signal, one may employ either locally normalized or globally normalized shear estimators. The former is the standard approach when estimating cluster masses, while the latter is the more common method among peak finding efforts. While both approaches have identical signal-to-noise in the weak lensing limit, it is possible that higher order corrections or systematics considerations make one estimator preferable over the other. In this paper, we consider the efficacy of both estimators within the context of stacked weak lensing mass estimation in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find the two estimators have nearly identical statistical precision, even after including higher order corrections, but that these corrections must be incorporated into the analysis to avoid observationally relevant biases in the recovered masses. We also demonstrate that finite bin-width effects may be significant if not properly accounted for, and that the two estimators exhibit different systematics, particularly with respect to contamination of the source catalog by foreground galaxies. Thus, the two estimators may be employed as a systematics cross-check of each other. Stacked weak lensing in the DES should allow for the mean mass of galaxy clusters to be calibrated to about 2\% precision (statistical only), which can improve the figure of merit of the DES cluster abundance experiment by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 relative to the self-calibration expectation. A companion paper (Schmidt \& Rozo, 2010) investigates how the two types of estimators considered here impact weak lensing peak finding efforts.},

  abstract = {A new 10 meter diameter telescope is being constructed for deployment at the NSF South Pole research station. The telescope is designed for conducting large-area millimeter and sub-millimeter wave surveys of faint, low contrast emission, as required to map primary and secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. To achieve the required sensitivity and resolution, the telescope design employs an off-axis primary with a 10 meter diameter clear aperture. The full aperture and the associated optics will have a combined surface accuracy of better than 20 microns rms to allow precision operation in the submillimeter atmospheric windows. The telescope will be surrounded with a large reflecting ground screen to reduce sensitivity to thermal emission from the ground and local interference. The optics of the telescope will support a degree field of view at 2mm wavelength and will feed a new 1000-element micro-lithographed planar bolometric array with superconducting transition-edge sensors and frequency-multiplexed readouts. The first key project will be to conduct a survey over \${\textbackslash}sim 4000\$ degrees for galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect. This survey should find many thousands of clusters with a mass selection criteria that is remarkably uniform with redshift. Armed with redshifts obtained from optical and infrared follow-up observations, it is expected that the survey will enable significant constraints to be placed on the equation of state of the dark energy.},

  abstract = {Reducing the scatter between cluster mass and optical richness is a key goal for cluster cosmology from photometric catalogs. We consider various modifications to the red-sequence-matched filter richness estimator of Rozo et al. implemented on the maxBCG cluster catalog and evaluate the impact of these changes on the scatter in X-ray luminosity (LX ) at fixed richness, using LX from the ROSAT All-Sky Catalog as the best mass proxy available for the large area required. Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can reduce the recovered scatter, finding that {\textbackslash}sigma \_\{{\textbackslash}ln L\_X{\textbar}{\textbackslash}lambda \}=0.63+/- 0.02 for clusters with M 500c {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 1.6 {\texttimes} 1014 h -1 70 M {$\odot$}. The corresponding scatter in mass at fixed richness is {$\sigma$}ln M{\textbar}{$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness, comparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue galaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting galaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness estimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating richness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a priori calibrations of the red sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered richness is robust to up to 50\% uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well as to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span the 4000 {\AA} break of red-sequence galaxies. Consequently, our richness estimator can be used to compare richness estimates of different clusters, even if they do not share the same photometric data. Appendix A includes "easy-bake" instructions for implementing our optimal richness estimator, and we are releasing an implementation of the code that works with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, as well as an augmented maxBCG catalog with the {$\lambda$} richness measured for each cluster.},

MCXC-II has been compiled from publicly available ROSAT All Sky Survey-based (NORAS, REFLEX, BCS, SGP, NEP, MACS, CIZA, and RXGCC) and serendipitous (160SD, 400SD, SHARC, WARPS, and EMSS) X-ray cluster catalogues. Redshifts were systematically checked and updated when necessary, with additional redshift information (type and origin) added. The X-ray data were standardised to an overdensity of 500, using a new procedure based on the use of the original flux and aperture measurements available in the input catalogues. MCXC-II contains 2221 entries, now including objects from the REFLEX-II and RXGCC surveys, in addition to providing a complete and fully-homogenised sub-catalogue of all published MACS clusters. Duplicate entries from overlaps between the survey areas of the individual input catalogues were carefully handled. For each cluster, the MCXC-II provides three identifiers: redshift, coordinates, and membership in the original catalogue, along with standardised [0.1-2.4] keV band luminosity, L500, total mass, M500, and radius, R500. Uncertainties on L500 were computed from the flux errors in the original catalogues. MCXC-II additionally provides information on overlaps between the input catalogues, reporting the luminosity and its uncertainty when measurements from different surveys are available, along with notes on individual objects. Catalog MCXC-II is available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/688/A187},

  abstract = {The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Peculiar Velocity Survey aims to measure the peculiar velocities of early and late type galaxies within the DESI footprint using both the Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations. Direct measurements of peculiar velocities can significantly improve constraints on the growth rate of structure, reducing uncertainty by a factor of approximately 2.5 at redshift 0.1 compared to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey's redshift space distortion measurements alone. We assess the quality of stellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These measurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the Fundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of early-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698 unique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64{\textbackslash}\% of observed galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10{\textbackslash}\%. This percentage increases to 75{\textbackslash}\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity dispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit the Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood algorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In addition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance measurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant, \$H\_0 = 76.05 {\textbackslash}pm 0.35\$(statistical) \${\textbackslash}pm 0.49\$(systematic FP) \${\textbackslash}pm 4.86\$(statistical due to calibration) \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km {\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$.

  abstract = {Cluster weak lensing is a sensitive probe of cosmology, particularly the amplitude of matter clustering \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ and matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$. The main nuisance parameter in a cluster weak lensing cosmological analysis is the scatter between the true halo mass and the relevant cluster observable, denoted \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln Mc\}\$. We show that combining the cluster weak lensing observable \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}Sigma\$ with the projected cluster-galaxy cross-correlation function \$w\_\{p,cg\}\$ and galaxy auto-correlation function \$w\_\{p,gg\}\$ can break the degeneracy between \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln Mc\}\$ to achieve tight, percent-level constraints on \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we compute derivatives of \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}Sigma\$, \$w\_\{p,cg\}\$, and \$w\_\{p,gg\}\$ with respect to \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln Mc\}\$ and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters describing the galaxy population. We also compute covariance matrices motivated by the properties of the Dark Energy Suvery (DES) cluster and weak lensing survey and the BOSS CMASS galaxy redshift survey. For our fiducial scenario combining \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}Sigma\$, \$w\_\{p,cg\}\$, and \$w\_\{p,gg\}\$ measured over \$0.3-30.0 {\textbackslash}; h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$, for clusters at \$z=0.35-0.55\$ above a mass threshold \$M\_c{\textbackslash}approx 2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}; h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, we forecast a \$1.4{\textbackslash}\%\$ constraint on \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ while marginalizing over \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln Mc\}\$ and all HOD parameters. Reducing the mass threshold to \$1{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}; h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ and adding a \$z=0.15-0.35\$ redshift bin sharpens this constraint to \$0.8{\textbackslash}\%\$.

  abstract = {Galaxies and their dark-matter halos have posed several challenges to the Dark Energy plus Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model. These discrepancies between observations and theory intensify for the lowest-mass (`dwarf') galaxies. LCDM predictions for the number, spatial distribution, and internal structure of low-mass dark-matter halos have historically been at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, but this is partially expected, because many predictions modeled only the dark-matter component. Any robust LCDM prediction must include, hand-in-hand, a model for galaxy formation to understand how baryonic matter populates and affects dark-matter halos. In this article, we review the most notable challenges to LCDM regarding dwarf galaxies, and we discuss how recent cosmological numerical simulations have pinpointed baryonic solutions to these challenges. We identify remaining tensions, including the diversity of the inner dark-matter content, planes of satellites, stellar morphologies, and star-formation quenching. Their resolution, or validation as actual problems to LCDM, will likely require both refining galaxy formation models and improving numerical accuracy in simulations.},

  abstract = {Context. In November 2019, eROSITA on board of the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory started to map the entire sky in X-rays. After the four-year survey program, it will reach a flux limit that is about 25 times deeper than ROSAT. During the SRG performance verification phase, eROSITA observed a contiguous 140 deg2 area of the sky down to the final depth of the eROSITA all-sky survey (eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey; eFEDS), with the goal of obtaining a census of the X-ray emitting populations (stars, compact objects, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and active galactic nuclei) that will be discovered over the entire sky. Aims: This paper presents the identification of the counterparts to the point sources detected in eFEDS in the main and hard samples and their multi-wavelength properties, including redshift. Methods: To identifyy the counterparts, we combined the results from two independent methods (NWAY and ASTROMATCH), trained on the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of 23k XMM-Newton sources detected in the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR8. Then spectroscopic redshifts and photometry from ancillary surveys were collated to compute photometric redshifts. Results: Of the eFEDS sources, 24 774 of 27 369 have reliable counterparts (90.5\%) in the main sample and 231 of 246 sourcess (93.9\%) have counterparts in the hard sample, including 2514 (3) sources for which a second counterpart is equally likely. By means of reliable spectra, Gaia parallaxes, and/or multi-wavelength properties, we have classified the reliable counterparts in both samples into Galactic (2695) and extragalactic sources (22 079). For about 340 of the extragalactic sources, we cannot rule out the possibility that they are unresolved clusters or belong to clusters. Inspection of the distributions of the X-ray sources in various optical/IR colour-magnitude spaces reveal a rich variety of diverse classes of objects. The photometric redshifts are most reliable within the KiDS/VIKING area, where deep near-infrared data are also available. Conclusions: This paper accompanies the eROSITA early data release of all the observations performed during the performance and verification phase. Together with the catalogues of primary and secondary counterparts to the main and hard samples of the eFEDS survey, this paper releases their multi-wavelength properties and redshifts.

  abstract = {We perform a joint analysis of intrinsic alignments and cosmology using tomographic weak lensing, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements from Year 1 (Y1) of the Dark Energy Survey. We define early- and late-type subsamples, which are found to pass a series of systematics tests, including for spurious photometric redshift error and point spread function correlations. We analyse these split data alongside the fiducial mixed Y1 sample using a range of intrinsic alignment models. In a fiducial Nonlinear Alignment Model (NLA) analysis, assuming a flat {\textbackslash}lcdm{\textasciitilde}cosmology, we find a significant difference in intrinsic alignment amplitude, with early-type galaxies favouring \$A\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{IA\} = 2.38{\textasciicircum}\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.31\}\$ and late-type galaxies consistent with no intrinsic alignments at \$0.05{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.09\}\$. We find weak evidence of a diminishing alignment amplitude at higher redshifts in the early-type sample. The analysis is repeated using a number of extended model spaces, including a physically motivated model that includes both tidal torquing and tidal alignment mechanisms. In multiprobe likelihood chains in which cosmology, intrinsic alignments in both galaxy samples and all other relevant systematics are varied simultaneously, we find the tidal alignment and tidal torquing parts of the intrinsic alignment signal have amplitudes \$A\_1 = 2.66 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.67\}\_\{-0.66\}\$, \$A\_2=-2.94{\textasciicircum}\{+1.94\}\_\{-1.83\}\$, respectively, for early-type galaxies and \$A\_1 = 0.62 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.41\}\_\{-0.41\}\$, \$A\_2 = -2.26{\textasciicircum}\{+1.30\}\_\{-1.16\}\$ for late-type galaxies. In the full (mixed) Y1 sample the best constraints are \$A\_1 = 0.70 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.41\}\_\{-0.38\}\$, \$A\_2 = -1.36 {\textasciicircum}\{+1.08\}\_\{-1.41\}\$.

  abstract = {In Stage-IV imaging surveys, a significant amount of the cosmologically useful information is due to sources whose images overlap with those of other sources on the sky. The cosmic shear signal is primarily encoded in the estimated shapes of observed galaxies and thus directly impacted by overlaps. We introduce a framework based on the Fisher formalism to analyze effects of overlapping sources (blending) on the estimation of cosmic shear. For the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present the expected loss in statistical sensitivity for the ten-year survey due to blending. We find that for approximately 62\% of galaxies that are likely to be detected in full-depth LSST images, at least 1\% of the flux in their pixels is from overlapping sources. We also find that the statistical correlations between measures of overlapping galaxies and, to a much lesser extent the higher shot noise level due to their presence, decrease the effective number density of galaxies, \$N\_\{eff\}\$, by \${\textbackslash}sim\$18\%. We calculate an upper limit on \$N\_\{eff\}\$ of 39.4 galaxies per arcmin\${\textasciicircum}2\$ in \$r\$ band. We study the impact of varying stellar density on \$N\_\{eff\}\$ and illustrate the diminishing returns of extending the survey into lower Galactic latitudes. We extend the Fisher formalism to predict the increase in pixel-noise bias due to blending for maximum-likelihood (ML) shape estimators. We find that noise bias is sensitive to the particular shape estimator and measure of ensemble-average shape that is used, and properties of the galaxy that include redshift-dependent quantities such as size and luminosity.},

They have come to play a central role both within and beyond statistics, providing the basis for power analysis in molecular biology, theory building in particle physics, and resource allocation in epidemiology, for example. We introduce the probabilistic and computational concepts underlying modern generative models and then analyze how they can be used to inform experimental design, iterative model refinement, goodness-of-fit evaluation, and agent based simulation. We emphasize a modular view of generative mechanisms and discuss how they can be flexibly recombined in new problem contexts. We provide practical illustrations throughout, and code for reproducing all examples is available at https://github.com/krisrs1128/generative\_review. Finally, we observe how research in generative models is currently split across several islands of activity, and we highlight opportunities lying at disciplinary intersections.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are gravitationally bound configurations containing typically hundreds of galaxies in a region about 1025 cm in size. They range from irregular clusters, with strong subclustering, no strong central concentration, and mainly spiral galaxies, to regular clusters, with smooth and centrally condensed galaxy distributions containing few spiral galaxies. Observations of these clusters of galaxies show that they are bright x-ray sources, with luminosities of 1043-45 ergs/sec. It is now established that the emission mechanism is thermal bremsstrahlung from hot ({\textasciitilde}108 K), low-density ({\textasciitilde}10-3 atoms/cm-3) gas. This intracluster gas has a distribution similar to that of the galaxies in the cluster and fills the space between the galaxies. Remarkably, the total mass of hot gas in a typical cluster is similar to the total mass in all the stars in all the galaxies in the cluster. The x-ray spectra of clusters show strong x-ray line emission from iron and other heavy elements; this indicates that a significant portion of the intracluster gas must have been ejected from galaxies in the cluster. Recent x-ray observations from the Einstein x-ray satellite show that intracluster gas is cooling in some clusters and being accreted onto large, central galaxies. X-ray images from Einstein also suggest that the morphology of the gas mirrors the dynamical state of the cluster. In this paper the x-ray observations of clusters of galaxies are reviewed. Related optical and radio measurements of clusters are also summarized. Theories for the physical state, distribution, origin, and evolution of the intracluster medium are extensively discussed. Finally, the author comments on the prospects for future x-ray observations.},

We identify 25 clusters between 0.1 {$\lessequivlnt$} z {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.8 in the union of the SPT-SZ and redMaPPer (RM) samples. RM is an optical cluster finding algorithm that also returns a richness estimate for each cluster.

We demonstrate that our model provides an adequate description of the matched sample, showing that the fraction of SPT-SZ-selected clusters with RM counterparts is consistent with expectations and that the fraction of RM-selected clusters with SPT-SZ counterparts is in mild tension with expectation. We model the optical-SZE cluster positional offset distribution with the sum of two Gaussians, showing that it is consistent with a dominant, centrally peaked population and a subdominant population characterized by larger offsets. We also cross-match the RM catalogue with SPT-SZ candidates below the official catalogue threshold significance {$\xi$} = 4.5, using the RM catalogue to provide optical confirmation and redshifts for 15 additional clusters with {$\xi$} {$\in$} [4, 4.5].},

The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of the 2500 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the degeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting as priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated using SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al. (2010, A10) X-ray analysis. We measure the SPT signal to noise \${\textbackslash}zeta\$-\${\textbackslash}lambda\$, relation and two integrated Compton-\$y\$ \$Y\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{500\}\$-\${\textbackslash}lambda\$ relations for the DES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting for the SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with \${\textbackslash}lambda {$>$} 80\$, the two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements, while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of \$0.61 {\textbackslash}pm 0.12\$ compared to the prediction. For clusters at \$20 {$<$} {\textbackslash}lambda {$<$} 80\$, the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.20-0.80 (between 2.3 and 10{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ significance) compared to the prediction, with the SPT calibrated scaling relations and larger \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ clusters showing generally better agreement. We quantify the required corrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependent bias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of the observables and biases in the estimated masses. We discuss possible physical effects, as contamination from line-of-sight projections or from point sources, larger offsets in the SZE-optical centering or larger scatter in the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$-mass relation at lower richnesses.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for each of FLAMINGO's three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc on a side and baryonic particle masses of 1 {\texttimes} 108 and 1 {\texttimes} 109 M{$\odot$}, respectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc simulation follows 3 {\texttimes} 1011 particles, making it the largest ever hydrodynamical simulation run to z = 0. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing hydrodynamical and 'dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up to {$\approx$}20 per cent.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic alignments (IA), correlations between the intrinsic shapes and orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus especially important to model IA with high accuracy. Efforts to use cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the epoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a dependence of IA on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-IA bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved IA coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the degree of nonlocality represents the memory of a galaxy's path from the time of its formation to the time of observation. We discuss how this result can be used to constrain the redshift at which IA is determined and provide Fisher estimation for the relevant measurements using the example of SDSS-BOSS.},

  abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the shear field contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this paper we show that B-modes in fact are produced by lensing itself. The effect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift. After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear field into E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this effect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed; it can not account for the apparent detection of a B-mode contribution on large angular scales in the cosmic shear analysis of van Waerbeke et al. (2002).},

Beginning with simple models and basic properties of the lens mapping, the book proceeds to more complicated recent analytical and numerical treatments, thereby highlighting the prominent role played by lensing statistics in the interpretation of high-redshift objects. A detailed description of microlensing is given. The potential role of gravitational lenses as astronomical tools, for example, to determine the masses of cosmic objects and the scale of the universe and as natural telescopes, is pointed out. On the observational side, details of several known multiple QSOs, radio rings and luminous arcs, and the difficulties of observation and verification of lens systems are summarized. The basics of catastophe theory, to the extent that it concerns singularities of plane maps, are derived and some techniques for numerical treatments of gravitational lensing are listed.

By selecting an appropriate spatial filter function, the dispersion of the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projected density field with a narrow kernel, so that {$<$}Map**2(theta){$>$} provides a well localized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s{\textasciitilde}5/theta. We calculate {$<$}Map**2(theta){$>$} for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linear power spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. The non-linear evolution yields a significant increase of {$<$}Map**2{$>$} relative to the linear growth on scales below {\textasciitilde}0.5 degree. The third-order moment of Map can be used to define a skewness, which is a measure of the non-Gaussianity of the density field. We present the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame of quasi-linear theory of structure growth. We show that it yields a sensitive measure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of the normalization of the power spectrum. Several practical estimates for {$<$}Map**2{$>$} are constructed and their dispersions calculated. We show that one sq.deg. of a high-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear with the Map-statistics on scales below {\textasciitilde}10 arcmin, and to estimate its amplitude with an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}30\% on scales below {\textasciitilde}5 arcmin.

As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on details in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for baryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic correction model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only N-body simulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted feedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot gas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3- central galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all modify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles allow to define a displacement field for particles in N-body simulations and to modify the total density field accordingly.},

  abstract = {Feedback processes from baryons are expected to strongly affect weak-lensing observables of current and future cosmological surveys. In this paper we present a new parametrisation of halo profiles based on gas, stellar, and dark matter density components. This parametrisation is used to modify outputs of gravity-only N-body simulations (following the prescription of [1]) in order to mimic baryonic effects on the matter density field. The resulting baryonic correction model relies on a few well motivated physical parameters and is able to reproduce the redshift zero clustering signal of hydrodynamical simulations at two percent accuracy below k{\textasciitilde}10 h/Mpc. A detailed study of the baryon suppression effects on the matter power spectrum and the weak lensing shear correlation reveals that the signal is dominated by two parameters describing the slope of the gas profile in haloes and the maximum radius of gas ejection. We show that these parameters can be constrained with the observed gas fraction of galaxy groups and clusters from X-ray data. Based on these observations we predict a beyond percent effect on the power spectrum above k=0.2-1.0 h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 15-25 percent around k{\textasciitilde} 10 h/Mpc. As a result, the weak lensing angular shear power spectrum is suppressed by 15-25 percent at scales beyond l{\textasciitilde} 100-600 and the shear correlations {$\xi$}+ and {$\xi$}- are affected at the 10-25 percent level below 5 and 50 arc-minutes, respectively. The relatively large uncertainties of these predictions are a result of the poorly known hydrostatic mass bias of current X-ray observations as well as the generic difficulty to observe the low density gas outside of haloes.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies are embedded into triaxial dark matter haloes, which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak gravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters, whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine data from five weak lensing surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS, listed in order of most to least constraining) in order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain fh, the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the light distribution, finding fh = 0.303-0.079+0.080 for red lens galaxies and fh = 0.217-0.159+0.160 for blue lens galaxies when assuming elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the currently most significant (3.8{$\sigma$}) systematics-corrected detection of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in good agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment. Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above are correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of {$\langle\vert\epsilon$}h{\textbar}{$\rangle$} = 0.174 {\textpm} 0.046, where {\textbar}{$\epsilon$}h{\textbar} = (1 - q)/(1 + q) relates to the ratio q = b/a of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar measurements based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models for intrinsic galaxy alignments, which constitute an important source of systematic uncertainty in cosmological weak lensing studies.},

  abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise measurements of three-point shear correlations and the third moment of the mass aperture statistic using the first 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey. We additionally obtain the first measurements of the configuration and scale dependence of the four three-point shear correlations which carry cosmological information. With the third-order mass aperture statistic, we present tomographic measurements over angular scales of 4 to 60 arcminutes with a combined statistical significance of 15.0\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. Using the tomographic information and measuring also the second-order mass aperture, we additionally obtain a skewness parameter and its redshift evolution. We find that the amplitudes and scale-dependence of these shear 3pt functions are in qualitative agreement with measurements in a mock galaxy catalog based on N-body simulations, indicating promise for including them in future cosmological analyses. We validate our measurements by showing that B-modes, parity-violating contributions and PSF modeling uncertainties are negligible, and determine that the measured signals are likely to be of astrophysical and gravitational origin.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on cosmological parameters based on a sample of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected (SZ-selected) galaxy clusters detected in a millimeter-wave survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The cluster sample used in this analysis consists of nine optically confirmed high-mass clusters comprising the high-significance end of the total cluster sample identified in 455 deg2 of sky surveyed during 2008 at 148 GHz. We focus on the most massive systems to reduce the degeneracy between unknown cluster astrophysics and cosmology derived from SZ surveys. We describe the scaling relation between cluster mass and SZ signal with a four-parameter fit. Marginalizing over the values of the parameters in this fit with conservative priors gives {$\sigma$}8 = 0.851 {\textpm} 0.115 and w = -1.14 {\textpm} 0.35 for a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year priors on cosmological parameters. This gives a modest improvement in statistical uncertainty over WMAP seven-year constraints alone. Fixing the scaling relation between the cluster mass and SZ signal to a fiducial relation obtained from numerical simulations and calibrated by X-ray observations, we find {$\sigma$}8 = 0.821 {\textpm} 0.044 and w = -1.05 {\textpm} 0.20. These results are consistent with constraints from WMAP7 plus baryon acoustic oscillations plus Type Ia supernova which give {$\sigma$}8 = 0.802 {\textpm} 0.038 and w = -0.98 {\textpm} 0.053. A stacking analysis of the clusters in this sample compared to clusters simulated assuming the fiducial model also shows good agreement. These results suggest that, given the sample of clusters used here, both the astrophysics of massive clusters and the cosmological parameters derived from them are broadly consistent with current models.},

  abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further information besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

These results open up new opportunities to extract cosmological information in galaxy surveys and may have important consequences for the planning of future redshift surveys.},

  abstract = {The mass and structural evolution of massive galaxies is one of the hottest topics in galaxy formation. This is because it may reveal invaluable insights into the still debated evolutionary processes governing the growth and assembly of spheroids. However, direct comparison between models and observations is usually prevented by the so-called progenitor bias, i.e., new galaxies entering the observational selection at later epochs, thus eluding a precise study of how pre-existing galaxies actually evolve in size. To limit this effect, we here gather data on high-redshift brightest group and cluster galaxies, evolve their (mean) host halo masses down to z = 0 along their main progenitors, and assign as their "descendants" local Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies matched in host halo mass. At face value, the comparison between high redshift and local data suggests a noticeable increase in stellar mass of a factor of {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 2 since z {\textasciitilde} 1, and of {$>$}{\textasciitilde} 2.5 in mean effective radius. We then compare the inferred stellar mass and size growth with those predicted by hierarchical models for central galaxies, selected at high redshifts to closely match the halo and stellar mass bins as in the data. Only hierarchical models characterized by very limited satellite stellar stripping and parabolic orbits are capable of broadly reproducing the stellar mass and size increase of a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-4 observed in cluster galaxies since z {\textasciitilde} 1. The predicted, average (major) merger rate since z {\textasciitilde} 1 is in good agreement with the latest observational estimates.},

The simulated images contained semi-realistic galaxies, stars with representative distributions of magnitudes and galactic spatial density, cosmic rays, bad CCD columns and spatially variable point spread functions. Bright stars were saturated and simulated ``bleed trails'' were drawn. Problem areas were interpolated, and the images were coadded into small cells, excluding images not fully covering the cell to guarantee a continuous point spread function. In all our tests the measured shear was accurate within the LSST requirements.},

  abstract = {Metacalibration is a new technique for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear that is unbiased for isolated galaxy images. In this work we test metacalibration with overlapping, or ``blended'' galaxy images. Using standard metacalibration, we find a few percent shear measurement bias for galaxy densities relevant for current surveys, and that this bias increases with increasing galaxy number density. We show that this bias is not due to blending itself, but rather to shear-dependent object detection. If object detection is shear independent, no deblending of images is needed, in principle. We demonstrate that detection biases are accurately removed when including object detection in the metacalibration process, a technique we call metadetection. This process involves applying an artificial shear to images of small regions of sky and performing detection on the sheared images, as well as measurements that are used to calculate a shear response. We demonstrate that the method can accurately recover weak shear signals even in highly blended scenes. In the metacalibration process, the space between objects is sheared coherently, which does not perfectly match the real universe in which some, but not all, galaxy images are sheared coherently. We find that even for the worst case scenario, in which the space between objects is completely unsheared, the resulting shear bias is at most a few tenths of a percent for future surveys. We discuss additional technical challenges that must be met in order to implement metadetection for real surveys.},

The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations with galaxy images that had relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and selection biases. We also observe that for images with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the metacalibration process results in significant bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread function ellipticity at the five-percent level. In each simulation we applied a small few-percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties to induce significant selection effects. Using our formalism, we recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in all cases.},

The large SDSS data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median and dispersion {$\sigma$}lnR. For late-type galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0{\textasciitilde}-20.5 (assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M0{\textasciitilde} 1010.6 Msolar. Galaxies more massive than M0 have and {$\sigma$}lnR{\textasciitilde} 0.3, while less massive galaxies have and {$\sigma$}lnR{\textasciitilde} 0.5. For early-type galaxies, the relation is significantly steeper, , but the {$\sigma$}lnR-M relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model. Fitting the observed {$\sigma$}lnR-M relation requires in addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type galaxies, the observed {$\sigma$}lnR-M relation is inconsistent with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.},

However, mis-identification of members due to projection effects from the large scale structure can occur. We studied the impact of projection effects on the measurement of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy clusters, using galaxy cluster mock catalogs. Our findings showed that projection effects result in a decrease of the large scale intrinsic alignment signal of the cluster and produce a bump at \$r\_p{\textbackslash}sim 1h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}/Mpc\$, most likely due to interlopers and missed member galaxies. This decrease in signal explains the observed similar alignment strength between bright central galaxies and clusters in the SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalog. The projection effect and cluster intrinsic alignment signal are coupled, with clusters having lower fractions of missing members or having higher fraction of interlopers exhibiting higher alignment signals in their projected shapes. We aim to use these findings to determine the impact of projection effects on galaxy cluster cosmology in future studies.},

We use monte-carlo simulations of elliptical cluster density profiles to estimate and correct for Poisson noise bias, edge bias and projection effects. We apply our methodology to 10,428 SDSS clusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm with richness above 20. We find a mean ellipticity \$= 0.271 {\textbackslash}pm 0.002\$ (stat) \${\textbackslash}pm 0.031\$ (sys) corresponding to an axis ratio \$= 0.573 {\textbackslash}pm 0.002\$ (stat) \${\textbackslash}pm 0.039\$ (sys). We compare this ellipticity of the satellites to the halo shape, through a stacked lensing measurement using optimal estimators of the lensing quadrupole based on Clampitt and Jain (2016). We find a best-fit axis ratio of \$0.56 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$ (stat) \${\textbackslash}pm 0.03\$ (sys), consistent with the ellipticity of the satellite distribution. Thus cluster galaxies trace the shape of the dark matter halo to within our estimated uncertainties. Finally, we restack the satellite and lensing ellipticity measurements along the major axis of the cluster central galaxy's light distribution. From the lensing measurements we infer a misalignment angle with an RMS of \$\{30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ {\textbackslash}pm 10\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ when stacking on the central galaxy. We discuss applications of halo shape measurements to test the effects of the baryonic gas and AGN feedback, as well as dark matter and gravity. The major improvements in signal-to-noise expected with the ongoing Dark Energy Survey and future surveys from LSST, Euclid and WFIRST will make halo shapes a useful probe of these effects.},

  abstract = {We derive constraints on dark matter (DM) annihilation cross section and decay lifetime from cross-correlation analyses of the data from Fermi-LAT and weak lensing surveys that cover a wide area of \${\textbackslash}sim660\$ squared degrees in total. We improve upon our previous analyses by using an updated extragalactic \${\textbackslash}gamma\$-ray background data reprocessed with the Fermi Pass 8 pipeline, and by using well-calibrated shape measurements of about twelve million galaxies in the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and Red-Cluster-Sequence Lensing Survey (RCSLenS). We generate a large set of full-sky mock catalogs from cosmological \$N\$-body simulations and use them to estimate statistical errors accurately. The measured cross correlation is consistent with null detection, which is then used to place strong cosmological constraints on annihilating and decaying DM. For leptophilic DM, the constraints are improved by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim100\$ in the mass range of O(1) TeV when including contributions from secondary \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ rays due to the inverse-Compton upscattering of background photons. Annihilation cross-sections of \${\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}sigma v {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-23\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}3/\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}\$ are excluded for TeV-scale DM depending on channel. Lifetimes of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{25\}\$ sec are also excluded for the decaying TeV-scale DM. Finally, we apply this analysis to wino DM and exclude the wino mass around 200 GeV. These constraints will be further tightened, and all the interesting wino DM parameter region can be tested, by using data from future wide-field cosmology surveys.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed comparison between the well-known smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET and the new moving-mesh code AREPO on a number of hydrodynamical test problems. Through a variety of numerical experiments with increasing complexity we establish a clear link between simple test problems with known analytic solutions and systematic numerical effects seen in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Our tests demonstrate deficiencies of the SPH method in several sectors. These accuracy problems not only manifest themselves in idealized hydrodynamical tests, but also propagate to more realistic simulation set-ups of galaxy formation, ultimately affecting local and global gas properties in the full cosmological framework, as highlighted in companion papers by Vogelsberger et al. and Keres et al. We find that an inadequate treatment of fluid instabilities in GADGET suppresses entropy generation by mixing, underestimates vorticity generation in curved shocks and prevents efficient gas stripping from infalling substructures. Moreover, in idealized tests of inside-out disc formation, the convergence rate of gas disc sizes is much slower in GADGET due to spurious angular momentum transport. In simulations where we follow the interaction between a forming central disc and orbiting substructures in a massive halo, the final disc morphology is strikingly different in the two codes. In AREPO, gas from infalling substructures is readily depleted and incorporated into the host halo atmosphere, facilitating the formation of an extended central disc. Conversely, gaseous sub-clumps are more coherent in GADGET simulations, morphologically transforming the central disc as they impact it. The numerical artefacts of the SPH solver are particularly severe for poorly resolved flows, and thus inevitably affect cosmological simulations due to their inherently hierarchical nature. Taken together, our numerical experiments clearly demonstrate that AREPO delivers a physically more reliable solution.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time-scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of at least equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next-generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the Universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present CORRFUNC - a suite of highly optimized, OPENMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of CORRFUNC arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. CORRFUNC can compute a wide range of 2D and 3D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. CORRFUNC runs efficiently in both single- and multithreaded modes and can compute a typical two-point projected correlation function [wp(rp)] for {$\sim$}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. CORRFUNC is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

We add observational realism to idealized synthetic images and measure non-parametric statistics in rest-frame optical and near-IR images from four directions. We find that Illustris creates a morphologically diverse galaxy population, occupying the observed bulge strength locus and reproducing median morphology trends versus stellar mass, SFR, and compactness. Morphology correlates realistically with rotation, following classification schemes put forth by kinematic surveys. Type fractions as a function of environment agree roughly with data. These results imply that connections among mass, star formation, and galaxy structure arise naturally from models matching global star formation and halo occupation functions when simulated with accurate methods. This raises a question of how to construct experiments on galaxy surveys to better distinguish between models. We predict that at fixed halo mass near 10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun, disc-dominated galaxies have higher stellar mass than bulge-dominated ones, a possible consequence of the Illustris feedback model. While Illustris galaxies at M\_* {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun have a reasonable size distribution, those at M\_* {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun have half-light radii larger than observed by a factor of two. Furthermore, at M\_* {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}10.5-10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun, a relevant fraction of Illustris galaxies have distinct "ring-like" features, such that the bright pixels have an unusually wide spatial extent.},

Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z {$\sim$} 2--3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

  abstract = {The initial mass function (IMF) for massive galaxies can be constrained by combining stellar dynamics with strong gravitational lensing. However, this method is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter and the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L). In this work, we reduce this degeneracy by combining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our analysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey and 1700 massive quiescent galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey main spectroscopic sample with weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a Bayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit the data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial gradient in the stellar M/L is required to simultaneously describe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong lenses with very steep total density profile that cannot be fitted by models with no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether M*/L gradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF, or to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of M*/L gradients decreases dramatically the inferred IMF normalization, compared to previous lensing-based studies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The main effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass distribution towards the high-mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF distribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected.},

  abstract = {Context. Strong lenses are a biased subset of the general population of galaxies. Aims. The goal of this work is to quantify how lens galaxies and lensed sources differ from their parent distribution, namely the strong lensing bias. Methods. We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a function of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing surveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong lensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities: the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{sps\}\$, defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass obtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar mass and size. Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards larger stellar masses, smaller half-mass radii and larger dark matter masses. The amplitude of the bias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the galaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens sample. For values of the scatter that are consistent with observed scaling relations and a minimum detectable Einstein radius of \$0.5''\$, the strong lensing bias in \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{sps\}\$ is \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$, while that in the central dark matter mass is \$5{\textbackslash}\%\$. The bias has little dependence on the properties of the source population: samples of galaxy-galaxy lenses and galaxy-quasar lenses that probe the same Einstein radius distribution are biased in a very similar way. Conclusions. Given current uncertainties, strong lensing observations can be used directly to improve our current knowledge of the inner structure of galaxies, without the need to correct for selection effects. Time-delay measurements of \$H\_0\$ from lensed quasars can take advantage of prior information obtained from galaxy-galaxy lenses with similar Einstein radii.},

  abstract = {The recently introduced discrete persistent structure extractor (DisPerSE, Sousbie, Paper I) is implemented on realistic 3D cosmological simulations and observed redshift catalogues; it is found that DisPerSE traces very well the observed filaments, walls and voids seen both in simulations and in observations. In either setting, filaments are shown to connect on to haloes, outskirt walls, which circumvent voids, as is topologically required by the Morse theory. Indeed this algorithm returns the optimal critical set while operating directly on the particles. DisPerSE, as illustrated here, assumes nothing about the geometry of the survey or its homogeneity, and yields a natural (topologically motivated) self-consistent criterion for selecting the significance level of the identified structures. It is shown that this extraction is possible even for very sparsely sampled point processes, as a function of the persistence ratio (a measure of the significance of topological connections between critical points). Hence, astrophysicists should be in a position to trace precisely the locus of filaments, walls and voids from such samples and assess the confidence of the post-processed sets as a function of this threshold, which can be expressed relative to the expected amplitude of shot noise. In a cosmic framework, this criterion is shown to level with the friends-of-friends structure finder for the identification of peaks, while it also identifies the connected filaments and walls, and quantitatively recovers the full set of topological invariants (number of holes, etc.) directly from the particles, and at no extra cost as a function of the persistence threshold. This criterion is found to be sufficient even if one particle out of two is noise, when the persistence ratio is set to 3{$\sigma$} or more. The algorithm is also implemented on the SDSS catalogue and used to locate interesting configurations of the filamentary structure. In this context, we carried the identification of an 'optically faint' cluster at the intersection of filaments through the recent observation of its X-ray counterpart by Suzaku.},

  abstract = {We present DisPerSE, a novel approach to the coherent multiscale identification of all types of astrophysical structures, in particular the filaments, in the large-scale distribution of the matter in the Universe. This method and the corresponding piece of software allows for a genuinely scale-free and parameter-free identification of the voids, walls, filaments, clusters and their configuration within the cosmic web, directly from the discrete distribution of particles in N-body simulations or galaxies in sparse observational catalogues. To achieve that goal, the method works directly over the Delaunay tessellation of the discrete sample and uses the Delaunay tessellation field estimator density computed at each tracer particle; no further sampling, smoothing or processing of the density field is required. The idea is based on recent advances in distinct subdomains of the computational topology, namely the discrete Morse theory which allows for a rigorous application of topological principles to astrophysical data sets, and the theory of persistence, which allows us to consistently account for the intrinsic uncertainty and Poisson noise within data sets. Practically, the user can define a given persistence level in terms of robustness with respect to noise (defined as a 'number of {$\sigma$}') and the algorithm returns the structures with the corresponding significance as sets of critical points, lines, surfaces and volumes corresponding to the clusters, filaments, walls and voids - filaments, connected at cluster nodes, crawling along the edges of walls bounding the voids. From a geometrical point of view, the method is also interesting as it allows for a robust quantification of the topological properties of a discrete distribution in terms of Betti numbers or Euler characteristics, without having to resort to smoothing or having to define a particular scale. In this paper, we introduce the necessary mathematical background and describe the method and implementation, while we address the application to 3D simulated and observed data sets in the companion paper (Sousbie, Pichon \& Kawahara, Paper II).},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {$\sim$} 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z {$\simeq$} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2 M{$\odot$}. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {$\gamma$} is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.6 at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {$\sim$} 5 per cent.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code AREPO, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

For individual halos, our model approximates c(t) as a power law with a time-dependent index, such that at early times, concentration has a nearly constant value of c=3-4, and as cosmic time progresses, c(t) smoothly increases. Using large samples of halo merger trees taken from the Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 cosmological simulations, we demonstrate that our 3-parameter model can approximate the evolution of the concentration of individual halos with a typical accuracy of 0.1 dex for t{$>$}2 Gyr for all Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 halos of present-day mass greater than 10{\textasciicircum}11.5 Msun. We additionally present a new model of the evolution of the concentration of halo populations, which we show faithfully reproduces both average concentration growth, as well as the diversity of smooth trajectories of c(t), including capturing correlations with halo mass and halo assembly history. Our publicly available source code, Diffprof, can be used to generate Monte Carlo realizations of the concentration histories of cosmologically representative halo populations; Diffprof is differentiable due to its implementation in the JAX autodiff library, which facilitates the incorporation of our model into existing analytical halo model frameworks.},

We identify images which are less well-represented in the generator's latent space, and which the discriminator flags as less realistic; these are thus anomalous with respect to the rest of the data. We propose a new approach to characterize these anomalies based on a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the residual differences between the real and WGAN-reconstructed images. We construct a subsample of {\textasciitilde}9,000 highly anomalous images from our nearly million object sample, and further identify interesting anomalies within these; these include galaxy mergers, tidal features, and extreme star-forming galaxies.

The gamma-ray emission associated with these bubbles has a significantly harder spectrum (dN/dE {\textasciitilde} E -2) than the inverse Compton emission from electrons in the Galactic disk, or the gamma rays produced by the decay of pions from proton-interstellar medium collisions. There is no significant spatial variation in the spectrum or gamma-ray intensity within the bubbles, or between the north and south bubbles. The bubbles are spatially correlated with the hard-spectrum microwave excess known as the WMAP haze; the edges of the bubbles also line up with features in the ROSAT X-ray maps at 1.5-2 keV. We argue that these Galactic gamma-ray bubbles were most likely created by some large episode of energy injection in the GC, such as past accretion events onto the central massive black hole, or a nuclear starburst in the last {\textasciitilde}10 Myr. Dark matter annihilation/decay seems unlikely to generate all the features of the bubbles and the associated signals in WMAP and ROSAT; the bubbles must be understood in order to use measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner Galaxy as a probe of dark matter physics. Study of the origin and evolution of the bubbles also has the potential to improve our understanding of recent energetic events in the inner Galaxy and the high-latitude cosmic ray population.},

  abstract = {The clustering of dark matter halos depends on the assembly history of halos at fixed halo mass; a phenomenon referred to as {\textbackslash}textit\{halo assembly bias\}. Halo assembly bias is readily observed in cosmological simulations of dark matter. However, it is difficult to detect it in observations. The identification of galaxy or cluster properties correlated with the formation time of the halo at fixed halo mass and the ability to select galaxy clusters free from projection effects are the two most significant hurdles in the observational detection of halo assembly bias. The latter, in particular, can cause a misleading detection of halo assembly bias by boosting the amplitude of lensing and clustering on large scales. This study uses twelve different properties of central galaxies of SDSS redMaPPer clusters derived from spectroscopy to divide the clusters into sub-samples. We test the dependence of the clustering amplitude on these properties at fixed richness. We first infer halo mass and bias using weak lensing signals around the clusters using shapes of galaxies from the SDSS survey. We validate the bias difference between the two subsamples using cluster-galaxy cross-correlations. This methodology allows us to decouple the contamination due to the projection effects from the halo assembly bias signals. We do not find any significant evidence of a difference in the clustering amplitudes correlated with any of our explored properties. Our results indicate that central galaxy properties may not correlate significantly with the halo assembly histories at fixed richness.},

We find that "observed" clusters, i.e. clusters identified by our cluster finder algorithm, exhibit lensing and clustering signals that deviate from expectations based on a statistically isotropic halo model -- while both signals agree with halo model expectations on small scales, they show unexpected boosts on large scales, by up to a factor of 1.2 or 1.4 respectively. We identify the origin of these boosts as the inherent selection bias of optical cluster finders for clusters embedded within filaments aligned with the line-of-sight, and show that a minority (\${\textbackslash}sim 30{\textbackslash}\%\$) of such clusters within the entire sample is responsible for this observed boost. We discuss the implications of our results on previous studies of optical cluster, as well as prospects for identifying and mitigating projection effects in future cluster cosmology analyses.},

In the previous study, we found that the projection effects cause the boost on the amplitudes of clustering and lensing on large scale compared to the expected amplitudes in the absence of any projection effects. These boosts are caused by preferential selections of filamentary structure aligned to the line of sight due to distance uncertainties in photometric surveys. We model the projection effects with two simple assumptions and develop a novel method to quantify the size of the boost using cluster-galaxy cross-correlation functions. We validate our method using mock cluster catalogues built from cosmological N-body simulations and find that we can obtain unbiased constraints on the boost parameter with our model. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters and find that the size of the boost is roughly 20 per cent for all the richness bins except the cluster sample with the richness bin {$\lambda$} {$\in$} [30, 40]. This is the first study to constrain the boost parameter independent from cluster cosmology studies and provides a self-consistency test for the projection effects.},

The joint analysis of our observables in the context of the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model results in cosmological constraints for \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\} / 0.3\}=0.816{\textasciicircum}\{+0.041\}\_\{-0.039\}\$. Our result is consistent with the \$S\_8\$ inference from other cosmic microwave background- and large scale structure-based cosmology analyses, including the result from the {\textbackslash}emph\{Planck\} 2018 primary CMB analysis.},

For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

  abstract = {Likelihood-free inference provides a rigorous approach to performing Bayesian analysis using forward simulations only. The main advantage of likelihood-free methods is their ability to account for complex physical processes and observational effects in forward simulations. Here we explore the potential of likelihood-free forward modeling for Bayesian cosmological inference using the redshift evolution of the cluster abundance combined with weak-lensing mass calibration. We use two complementary likelihood-free methods, namely Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Density-Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (DELFI), to develop an analysis procedure for the inference of the cosmological parameters ({\textohm}m, {$\sigma$} 8) and the mass scale of the survey sample. Adopting an eROSITA-like selection function and a 10\% scatter in the observable-mass relation in a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with {\textohm}m = 0.286 and {$\sigma$} 8 = 0.82, we create a synthetic catalog of observable-selected Navarro-Frenk-White clusters in a survey area of 50 deg2. The stacked tangential shear profile and the number counts in redshift bins are used as summary statistics for both methods. By performing a series of forward simulations, we obtain convergent solutions for the posterior distribution from both methods. We find that ABC recovers broader posteriors than DELFI, especially for the {\textohm}m parameter. For a weak-lensing survey with a source density of n g = 20 arcmin-2, we obtain posterior constraints on \$\{S\}\_\{8\}=\{{\textbackslash}sigma \}\_\{8\}\{{\textbackslash}left(\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{{\textbackslash}Omega \}\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}\}/0.3{\textbackslash}right)\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.3\}\$ of 0.836 {\textpm} 0.032 and 0.810 {\textpm} 0.019 from ABC and DELFI, respectively. The analysis framework developed in this study will be particularly powerful for cosmological inference with ongoing cluster cosmology programs, such as the XMM-XXL survey and the eROSITA all-sky survey, in combination with wide-field weak-lensing surveys.},

  abstract = {In this paper, by analyzing mock images from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation, we examine the properties of the diffuse light and compare them to those of central and satellite galaxies. Our findings suggest that the majority of the diffuse light originates from satellites. This claim is supported by the similarity between the age and metallicity distributions of the diffuse light and those of the satellites. Notably, the color distribution of the diffuse light gradually evolves to resemble that of the centrals at lower redshifts, suggesting a coevolution or passive process. The radial profiles of the diffuse light reveal distinct trends, with the inner regions displaying a relatively flat distribution and the outer regions showing a descending pattern. This finding suggests that the formation of the diffuse light is influenced by both major mergers and stellar tidal stripping. Moreover, strong correlations are found between the stellar mass of the diffuse light and the overall stellar mass of the satellites, as well as between the stellar mass of the diffuse light and the number of satellites within groups or clusters. These relationships can be described by power-law and logarithmic functions. Overall, the diffuse light components predominantly originate from satellites with intermediate ages and metallicities. These satellites typically fall within the stellar mass range of \${\textbackslash}rm 8{$<\backslash$}log\_\{10\}M\_\{star\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{$<$} 10\$ and the color range of \${\textbackslash}rm -1{$<$}[g-r]{\textasciicircum}\{0.1\}{$<$} 0\$. As the redshift decreases, the growth of the diffuse light is primarily influenced by the redder satellites, while the most massive and reddest satellites have minimal roles in its growth.},

  abstract = {The mass distribution in massive elliptical galaxies encodes their evolutionary history, thus providing an avenue to constrain the baryonic astrophysics in their evolution. The power-law assumption for the radial mass profile in ellipticals has been sufficient to describe several observables to the noise level, including strong lensing and stellar dynamics. In this paper, we quantitatively constrained any deviation, or the lack thereof, from the power-law mass profile in massive ellipticals through joint lensing-dynamics analysis of a large statistical sample with 77 galaxy-galaxy lens systems. We performed an improved and uniform lens modelling of these systems from archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging using the automated lens modelling pipeline dolphin. We combined the lens model posteriors with the stellar dynamics to constrain the deviation from the power law after accounting for the line-of-sight lensing effects, a first for analyses on galaxy-galaxy lenses. We find that the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) lens galaxies with a mean redshift of 0.2 are consistent with the power-law profile within 1.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ (2.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) and the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) lens galaxies with a mean redshift of 0.6 are consistent within 0.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ (2.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$), for a spatially constant (Osipkov-Merritt) stellar anisotropy profile. We adopted the spatially constant anisotropy profile as our baseline choice based on previous dynamical observables of local ellipticals. However, spatially resolved stellar kinematics of lens galaxies are necessary to differentiate between the two anisotropy models. Future studies will use our lens models to constrain the mass distribution individually in the dark matter and baryonic components.},

  abstract = {We compare the shapes and intrinsic alignments of galaxies in the MassiveBlack-II (MBII) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to those in an identical dark matter-only (DMO) simulation. Understanding the impact of baryonic physics on galaxy shapes should prove useful for creating mock galaxy catalogues based on DMO simulations that mimic intrinsic alignments in hydrodynamic simulations. The dark matter subhaloes are typically rounder in MBII, and the shapes of stellar matter in low-mass galaxies are more misaligned with the shapes of dark matter of the corresponding subhaloes in the DMO simulation. At z~=~0.06, the fractional difference in the mean misalignment angle between MBII and DMO simulations varies from {$\sim$}28to12\,per\,cent in the mass range 1010.8--6.0~{\texttimes}~1014\,h-1\,M{$\odot$}. We study the dark matter halo shapes and alignments as a function of radius, and find that while galaxies in MBII are more aligned with the inner parts of their dark matter subhaloes, there is no radial trend in their alignments with the corresponding subhalo in the DMO simulation. This result highlights the importance of baryonic physics in determining galaxy alignments with inner parts of their halo. Finally, we find that the stellar-dark matter misalignment suppresses the ellipticity--direction (ED) correlation of galaxies in comparison to that of dark matter haloes. In the projected shape--density correlation (w{$\delta$} +), higher mean ellipticities of the stellar component reduce this effect, but differences of the order of 30--40\,per\,cent remain on scales \&gt;1~Mpc.},

We present detailed measurements of the galaxy intrinsic alignments and associated ellipticity-direction (ED) and projected shape (wg+) correlation functions for galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamic MassiveBlack-II simulation. We carefully assess the effects on galaxy shapes, misalignment of the stellar component with the dark matter shape and two-point statistics of iterative weighted (by mass and luminosity) definitions of the (reduced and unreduced) inertia tensor. We find that iterative procedures must be adopted for a reliable measurement of the reduced tensor but that luminosity versus mass weighting has only negligible effects. Both ED and wg+ correlations increase in amplitude with subhalo mass (in the range of 1010-6.0 {\texttimes} 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}), with a weak redshift dependence (from z = 1 to 0.06) at fixed mass. At z {$\sim$} 0.3, we predict a wg+ that is in reasonable agreement with Sloan Digital Sky Survey luminous red galaxy measurements and that decreases in amplitude by a factor of {$\sim$}5-18 for galaxies in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope survey. We also compared the intrinsic alignments of centrals and satellites, with clear detection of satellite radial alignments within their host haloes. Finally, we show that wg+ (using subhaloes as tracers of density) and w{$\delta$}+ (using dark matter density) predictions from the simulations agree with that of non-linear alignment (NLA) models at scales where the two-halo term dominates in the correlations (and tabulate associated NLA fitting parameters). The one-halo term induces a scale-dependent bias at small scales which is not modelled in the NLA model.},

  abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code {\textbackslash}citep\{kravtsov97\}, with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density Lambda CDM universe are reported, with 256\textsuperscript{3} particles and 4.1x 10\textsuperscript{7} cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192\textsuperscript{3}. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

  abstract = {We describe the Dark Energy Survey (DES), a proposed optical-near infrared survey of 5000 sq. deg of the South Galactic Cap to {\textasciitilde}24th magnitude in SDSS griz, that would use a new 3 sq. deg CCD camera to be mounted on the Blanco 4-m telescope at Cerro Telolo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

Clues to their origin come from studying the distribution of their arrival directions. Using 3 {\texttimes} 104 cosmic rays with energies above 8 {\texttimes} 1018 electron volts, recorded with the Pierre Auger Observatory from a total exposure of 76,800 km2 sr year, we determined the existence of anisotropy in arrival directions. The anisotropy, detected at more than a 5.2{$\sigma$} level of significance, can be described by a dipole with an amplitude of  6.5 - 0.9 + 1.3  percent toward right ascension {$\alpha$}d = 100 {\textpm} 10 degrees and declination {$\delta$}d =  - 24 - 13 + 12  degrees. That direction indicates an extragalactic origin for these ultrahigh-energy particles.},

  abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z{$<$}{\textasciitilde}2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msol/h {$<$} M {$<$} 10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} Msol/h, to {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 5\%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20\%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by {\textasciitilde}20-50\%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

  abstract = {We measure the clustering of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of the flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Halos are identified using the spherical overdensity algorithm, which finds the mass around isolated peaks in the density field such that the mean density is {$\Delta$} times the background. We calibrate fitting functions for the large-scale bias that are adaptable to any value of {$\Delta$} we examine. We find a {\textasciitilde}6\% scatter about our best-fit bias relation. Our fitting functions couple to the halo mass functions of Tinker et al. such that the bias of all dark matter is normalized to unity. We demonstrate that the bias of massive, rare halos is higher than that predicted in the modified ellipsoidal collapse model of Sheth et al. and approaches the predictions of the spherical collapse model for the rarest halos. Halo bias results based on friends-of-friends halos identified with linking length 0.2 are systematically lower than for halos with the canonical {$\Delta$} = 200 overdensity by {\textasciitilde}10\%. In contrast to our previous results on the mass function, we find that the universal bias function evolves very weakly with redshift, if at all. We use our numerical results, both for the mass function and the bias relation, to test the peak-background split model for halo bias. We find that the peak-background split achieves a reasonable agreement with the numerical results, but {\textasciitilde}20\% residuals remain, both at high and low masses.},

These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of \$z=2.35\$ to a depth of \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{r\}\}=27\$. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties. This model can simultaneously fit galaxy clustering and group--galaxy cross-correlations measured in three different luminosity threshold samples. The Cardinal mocks also feature a new color assignment model that can simultaneously fit color-dependent galaxy clustering in three different luminosity bins. We have developed an algorithm that uses photometric data to improve the color assignment model further and have also developed a novel method to improve small-scale lensing below the ray-tracing resolution. These improvements enable the Cardinal mocks to accurately reproduce the abundance of galaxy clusters and the properties of lens galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey data. As such, these simulations will be a valuable tool for future cosmological analyses based on large sky surveys. The cardinal mock will be released upon publication at https://chunhaoto.com/cardinalsim.},

We use cosmological survey simulations designed to resemble the Dark Energy Survey Year One (DES-Y1) data to validate the analytical covariance matrix and the parameter inferences. The posterior distribution from the analysis of simulations is statistically consistent with the absence of systematic biases detectable at the precision of the DES Y1 experiment. We compare the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ values in simulations to their expectation and find no significant difference.

  abstract = {Combining multiple observational probes is a powerful technique to provide robust and precise constraints on cosmological parameters. In this letter, we present the first joint analysis of cluster abundances and auto/cross correlations of three cosmic tracer fields measured from the first year data of the Dark Energy Survey: galaxy density, weak gravitational lensing shear, and cluster density split by optical richness. From a joint analysis of cluster abundances, three cluster cross-correlations, and auto correlations of galaxy density, we obtain \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{m\}\}=0.305{\textasciicircum}\{+0.055\}\_\{-0.038\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8=0.783{\textasciicircum}\{+0.064\}\_\{-0.054\}\$. This result is consistent with constraints from the DES-Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing two-point correlation functions for the flat \${\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. We thus combine cluster abundances and all two-point correlations from three cosmic tracer fields and find improved constraints on cosmological parameters as well as on the cluster observable--mass scaling relation. This analysis is an important advance in both optical cluster cosmology and multi-probe analyses of upcoming wide imaging surveys.},

  abstract = {Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes, such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of the scaling relations, ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, remains unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies, significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter estimates.},

  abstract = {In this work we present relensing, a package written in python whose goal is to model galaxy clusters from gravitational lensing. With relensing we extent the amount of software available, which provides the scientific community with a wide range of models that help to compare and therefore validate the physical results that rely on them. We implement a free-form approach which computes the gravitational deflection potential on a adaptive irregular grid, from which one can characterize the cluster and its properties as a gravitational lens. Here, we use two alternative penalty functions to constrain strong lensing. We apply relensing to two toy models, in order to explore under which conditions one can get a better performance in the reconstruction. We find that by applying a smoothing to the deflection potential enhances the capability of this approach to recover the shape and size of the galaxy cluster's mass profile, as well as its magnification map, which translates in a better estimation of the critical and caustic curves. The power that the smoothing provides is also tested on the simulated clusters Ares and Hera, for which our results represent an improvement with respect to reconstructions that were carried out with methods of the same nature than relensing. At the same time, the smoothing also increases the stability of our implementation, and decreases the computation time. On its current state, relensing is available upon request.},

We find results that are consistent with previous cosmic shear constraints in \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ -- \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, and see no evidence for disagreement of our weak lensing data with data from the CMB. Finally, we find no evidence preferring a \$w\$CDM model allowing \$w{\textbackslash}ne -1\$. We expect further significant improvements with subsequent years of DES data, which will more than triple the sky coverage of our shape catalogs and double the effective integrated exposure time per galaxy.},

  abstract = {Aims: We estimate the amplitude of the source-lens clustering bias and of the intrinsic-alignment bias of weak-lensing estimators of the two-point and three-point convergence and cosmic-shear correlation functions. Methods: We use a linear galaxy bias model for the galaxy-density correlations, as well as a linear intrinsic-alignment model. For the three-point and four-point density correlations, we use analytical or semi-analytical models, based on a hierarchical ansatz or a combination of one-loop perturbation theory with a halo model. Results: For two-point statistics, we find that the source-lens clustering bias is typically several orders of magnitude below the weak-lensing signal, except when we correlate a very low-redshift galaxy (z2 {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.05) with a higher redshift galaxy (z1 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.5), where it can reach 10\% of the signal for the shear. For three-point statistics, the source-lens clustering bias is typically on the order of 10\% of the signal, as soon as the three galaxy source redshifts are not identical. The intrinsic-alignment bias is typically about 10\% of the signal for both two-point and three-point statistics. Thus, both source-lens clustering bias and intrinsic-alignment bias must be taken into account for three-point estimators aiming at a better than 10\% accuracy.

These clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate, were identified in 178 deg{\textasciicircum}2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole Telescope to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging from z=0.15 to z{$>$}1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy clusters, three were previously identified as Abell clusters, three were presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were first identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al, 2010; the remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100\% complete above a mass threshold of M\_200 {\textasciitilde} 5x10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun/h at z = 0.6. This completeness threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to {\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun/h at z=1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use the cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to the WMAP 7-year analysis yields sigma\_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a {\textasciitilde}50\% improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.},

Separating early- and late-type galaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-type galaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, and we find a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxy mass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, R effvprop(1 + z)-1.48, and moderate evolution for the late-type population, R effvprop(1 + z)-0.75. The large sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, in combination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive use of spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results but also enable us to probe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. At all redshifts the slope of the size-mass relation is shallow, R\_\{eff\}{\textbackslash}propto M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{0.22\}, for late-type galaxies with stellar mass {$>$}3 {\texttimes} 109 M {$\odot$}, and steep, R\_\{eff\}{\textbackslash}propto M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{0.75\}, for early-type galaxies with stellar mass {$>$}2 {\texttimes} 1010 M {$\odot$}. The intrinsic scatter is lsim0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. For late-type galaxies, the logarithmic size distribution is not symmetric but is skewed toward small sizes: at all redshifts and masses, a tail of small late-type galaxies exists that overlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. The number density of massive ({\textasciitilde}1011 M {$\odot$}), compact (R eff {$<$} 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increases from z = 3 to z = 1.5-2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.},

In the present-day universe, star-forming galaxies of all masses 109-1011 M {$\odot$} are predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. We now extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (M * {$>$} 1010 M {$\odot$}) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z {$<$}{\textasciitilde} 2. Lower-mass galaxies at z {$>$} 1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction of elongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lower masses. Galaxies with stellar mass 109 M {$\odot$} (1010 M {$\odot$}) are a mix of roughly equal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 1 (z {\textasciitilde} 2). This suggests that galaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over many orbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar mass comparable to that of the Milky Way typically first formed such sustained stellar disks at redshift z {\textasciitilde} 1.5-2. Combined with constraints on the evolution of the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation over galaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmic time, the majority of stars formed in disks.

The sample is selected at a constant number density of n = 2 {\texttimes} 10-4 Mpc-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of {$\approx$}2 since z = 2, following the relation log Mn (z) = 11.45 - 0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred, we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images of galaxies with masses near Mn (z), at redshifts langzrang = 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of {\textasciitilde}28.5 mag arcsec-2. We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r = 5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift, whereas the mass at 5 kpc {$<$} r {$<$} 75 kpc has increased by a factor of {\textasciitilde}4 since z = 2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles, we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as re vprop (1 + z)-1.3 and n vprop (1 + z)-1.0, respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in situ star formation can only account for {\textasciitilde}20\% of the mass buildup from z = 2 to z = 0. A direct consequence of these results is that massive galaxies do not evolve in a self-similar way: their structural profiles change as a function of redshift, complicating analyses which (often implicitly) assume self-similarity. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

We use {$\sim$}100 deg2 of KiDS data to study the lensing signal around galaxies for which spectroscopic redshifts and stellar masses were determined by GAMA. We show that lensing alone results in poor constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relation due to a degeneracy between the satellite fraction and the halo mass, which is lifted when we simultaneously fit the stellar mass function. At M* {$>$} 5 {\texttimes} 1010 h- 2 M{$\odot$}, the stellar mass increases with halo mass as \{{$\sim$} \}M\_h{\textasciicircum}\{0.25\}. The ratio of dark matter to stellar mass has a minimum at a halo mass of 8 {\texttimes} 1011 h-1 M{$\odot$} with a value of M\_h/M\_\{*\}=56\_\{-10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+16\} [h]. We also use the GAMA group catalogue to select centrals and satellites in groups with five or more members, which trace regions in space where the local matter density is higher than average, and determine for the first time the stellar-to-halo mass relation in these denser environments. We find no significant differences compared to the relation from the full sample, which suggests that the stellar-to-halo mass relation does not vary strongly with local density. Furthermore, we find that the stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies can also be obtained by modelling the lensing signal and stellar mass function of satellite galaxies only, which shows that the assumptions to model the satellite contribution in the halo model do not significantly bias the stellar-to-halo mass relation. Finally, we show that the combination of weak lensing with the stellar mass function can be used to test the purity of group catalogues.},

  abstract = {We develop a novel data-driven method for generating synthetic optical observations of galaxy clusters. In cluster weak lensing, the interplay between analysis choices and systematic effects related to source galaxy selection, shape measurement, and photometric redshift estimation can be best characterized in end-to-end tests going from mock observations to recovered cluster masses. To create such test scenarios, we measure and model the photometric properties of galaxy clusters and their sky environments from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data in two bins of cluster richness \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}in [30; 45)\$, \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}in [45; 60)\$ and three bins in cluster redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}in [0.3; 0.35)\$, \$z{\textbackslash}in [0.45; 0.5)\$ and \$z{\textbackslash}in [0.6; 0.65)\$. Using deep-field imaging data, we extrapolate galaxy populations beyond the limiting magnitude of DES Y3 and calculate the properties of cluster member galaxies via statistical background subtraction. We construct mock galaxy clusters as random draws from a distribution function, and render mock clusters and line-of-sight catalogues into synthetic images in the same format as actual survey observations. Synthetic galaxy clusters are generated from real observational data, and thus are independent from the assumptions inherent to cosmological simulations. The recipe can be straightforwardly modified to incorporate extra information, and correct for survey incompleteness. New realizations of synthetic clusters can be created at minimal cost, which will allow future analyses to generate the large number of images needed to characterize systematic uncertainties in cluster mass measurements.},

We generate mock images with the properties of the CANDELS survey and derive Sersic parameters and optical rest-frame morphologies as usually done in the observations. Overall, the simulation reproduces the observed evolution of the abundances of different galaxy morphological types of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The log M* - log Re and log M* - log {$\Sigma$}1 relations of the simulated star-forming and quenched galaxies also match the observed slopes and zeropoints to within 1-{$\sigma$}. In the simulation, galaxies increase their observed central stellar mass density ({$\Sigma$}1) and transform in morphology from irregular/clumpy systems to normal Hubble-type systems in the star formation main sequence at a characteristic stellar mass of {\textasciitilde}1010.5 M{$\odot$} which is reflected in an increase of the central stellar mass density ({$\Sigma$}1). This morphological transformation is connected to the activity of the central super massive black holes (SMBHs). At low stellar masses (109 {$<$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 1010) SMBHs grow rapidly, while at higher mass SMBHs switch into the kinetic feedback mode and grow more slowly. During this low-accretion phase, SMBH feedback leads to the quenching of star-formation, along with a simultaneous growth in {$\Sigma$}1, partly due to the fading of stellar populations. More compact massive galaxies grow their SMBHs faster than extended ones of the same mass and end up quenching earlier. In the TNG50 simulation, SMBHs predominantly grow via gas accretion before galaxies quench, and {$\Sigma$}1 increases substantially after SMBH growth slows down. The simulation predicts therefore that quiescent galaxies have higher {$\Sigma$}1 values than star-forming galaxies for the same SMBH mass, which disagrees with alternative models, and may potentially be in tension with some observations.},

In this work, we build a model that infers the mass of a halo given the positions, velocities, stellar masses, and radii of the galaxies it hosts. In order to capture information from correlations among galaxy properties and their phase space, we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are designed to work with irregular and sparse data. We train our models on galaxies from more than 2000 state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations project. Our model, which accounts for cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties, is able to constrain the masses of the halos with a {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex accuracy. Furthermore, a GNN trained on a suite of simulations is able to preserve part of its accuracy when tested on simulations run with a different code that utilizes a distinct subgrid physics model, showing the robustness of our method. The PyTorch Geometric implementation of the GNN is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/PabloVD/HaloGraphNet).},

Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component.

  abstract = {Halo occupation distribution (HOD) models describe the number of galaxies that reside in different haloes, and are widely used in galaxy-halo connection studies using the halo model (HM). Here, we introduce and study HOD response functions \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ that describe the response of the HODs to long-wavelength perturbations \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\$. The linear galaxy bias parameters \$b\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ are a weighted version of \$b\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}h + R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$, where \$b\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}h\$ is the halo bias, but the contribution from \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ is routinely ignored in the literature. We investigate the impact of this by measuring the \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ in separate universe simulations of the IllustrisTNG model for three types of perturbations: total matter perturbations, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}={\textbackslash}delta\_m\$; baryon-CDM compensated isocurvature perturbations, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}={\textbackslash}sigma\$; and potential perturbations with local primordial non-Gaussianity, \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}propto f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NL\}{\textbackslash}phi\$. Our main takeaway message is that the \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ are not negligible in general and their size should be estimated on a case-by-case basis. For stellar-mass selected galaxies, the responses \$R\_{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}g\$ and \$R\_{\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}g\$ are sizeable and cannot be neglected in HM calculations of the bias parameters \$b\_{\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}g\$ and \$b\_{\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}g\$; this is relevant to constrain inflation using galaxies. On the other hand, we do not detect a strong impact of the HOD response \$R\_1{\textasciicircum}g\$ on the linear galaxy bias \$b\_1{\textasciicircum}g\$. These results can be explained by the impact that the perturbations have on stellar-to-total-mass relations. We also look into the impact on the bias of the gas distribution and find similar conclusions. We show that a single extra parameter describing the overall amplitude of \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ recovers the measured \$b\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ well, which indicates that \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textasciicircum}g\$ can be easily added to HM/HOD studies as a new ingredient.},

We explore if the effect of the cosmic web on galaxy properties is entirely transitive via host halo mass, or if the cosmic web has an effect independent of mass. The secondary galaxy bias, sometimes referred to as "galaxy assembly bias", is the beyond-mass component of the galaxy-halo connection. We investigate the link between the cosmic web environment and the secondary galaxy bias in simulations. We measure the secondary galaxy bias through the following summary statistics: projected two-point correlation function, \${\textbackslash}wprp\$, and counts-in-cylinders statistics, \${\textbackslash}Pncic\$. First, we examine the extent to which the secondary galaxy bias can be accounted for with a measure of the environment as a secondary halo property. We find that the total secondary galaxy bias preferentially places galaxies in more strongly clustered haloes. In particular, haloes at fixed mass tend to host more galaxies when they are more strongly associated with nodes or filaments. This tendency accounts for a significant portion, but not the entirety, of the total secondary galaxy bias effect. Second, we quantify how the secondary galaxy bias behaves differently depending on the host halo proximity to nodes and filaments. We find that the total secondary galaxy bias is relatively stronger in haloes more associated with nodes or filaments. We emphasise the importance of removing halo mass effects when considering the cosmic web environment as a factor in the galaxy-halo connection.},

Using 'Dark Sky', a suite of cosmological N-body simulations, we investigate how halo concentration evolves with time and emerges from the mass assembly history. We also explore the origin of the scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. We show that the evolution of halo concentration has two primary modes: (1) smooth increase due to pseudo-evolution; and (2) intense responses to physical merger events. Merger events induce lasting and substantial changes in halo structures, and we observe a universal response in the concentration parameter. We argue that merger events are a major contributor to the uncertainty in halo concentration at fixed halo mass and formation time. In fact, even haloes that are typically classified as having quiescent formation histories experience multiple minor mergers. These minor mergers drive small deviations from pseudo-evolution, which cause fluctuations in the concentration parameters and result in effectively irreducible scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo concentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if the recent merger history is unknown.},

Several correlations between {$\gamma$}- and galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius, stellar surface density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction, and in situ-formed stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG reproduces many correlation trends, and in particular, {$\gamma$}- is almost constant with redshift below z = 2. Through analysing IllustrisTNG model variations, we show that black hole kinetic winds are crucial to lowering {$\gamma$}- and matching observed galaxy correlations. The effects of stellar winds on {$\gamma$}- are subdominant compared to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and differ due to the presence of AGN feedback from previous works. The density profiles of the ETG dark matter haloes are well described by steeper than NFW profiles, and they are steeper in the full physics (FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter-only (DMO) run. Their inner density slopes anticorrelate (remain constant) with the halo mass in the FP (DMO) run, and anticorrelate with the halo concentration parameter c200 in both the types of runs.

  abstract = {Simulating the evolution of the local universe is important for studying galaxies and the intergalactic medium in a way free of cosmic variance. Here we present a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an input nonlinear density field, employing the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm combined with Particle-mesh (PM) dynamics. The HMC+PM method is applied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density fields are then evolved to the present day with N-body simulations. These constrained simulations accurately reproduce both the amplitudes and phases of the input simulations at various z. Using a PM model with a grid cell size of 0.75 h -1 Mpc and 40 time steps in the HMC can recover more than half of the phase information down to a scale k {\textasciitilde} 0.85 h Mpc-1 at high z and to k {\textasciitilde} 3.4 h Mpc-1 at z = 0, which represents a significant improvement over similar reconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can reconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical range. Adopting PM models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields even better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by the availability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models of structure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce non-Gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can cause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. Such deviations are greatly reduced or absent in our reconstruction.},

Although similar in appearance to massive globular clusters7, the detection of extended stellar envelopes4,8,9, complex star formation histories10, elevated mass-to-light ratio11,12 and supermassive black holes13-16 suggest that some UCDs are remnant nuclear star clusters17 of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies18,19, or even ancient compact galaxies20. However, only a few objects have been found in the transient stage of tidal stripping21,22, and this assumed evolutionary path19 has never been fully traced by observations. Here we show that 106 galaxies in the Virgo cluster have morphologies that are intermediate between normal, nucleated dwarf galaxies and single-component UCDs, revealing a continuum that fully maps this morphological transition and fills the `size gap' between star clusters and galaxies. Their spatial distribution and redder colour are also consistent with stripped satellite galaxies on their first few pericentric passages around massive galaxies23. The `ultra-diffuse' tidal features around several of these galaxies directly show how UCDs are forming through tidal stripping and that this evolutionary path can include an early phase as a nucleated ultra-diffuse galaxy24,25. These UCDs represent substantial visible fossil remnants of ancient dwarf galaxies in galaxy clusters, and more low-mass remnants probably remain to be found.},

These properties reflect the dynamical state of haloes, which in turn depends on the mass assembly history. In this work, we study the evolution of anisotropy properties in response to merger activity using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We find that the response trajectories of the anisotropy properties significantly deviate from secular evolution. These trajectories have the same qualitative features and timescales across a wide range of merger and host properties. We propose explanations for the behaviour of these properties and connect their evolution to the relevant stages of merger dynamics. We measure the relevant dynamical timescales. We also explore the dependence of the strength of the response on time of merger, merger ratio, and mass of the main halo. These results provide insight into the physics of halo mergers and their effects on the statistical behaviour of halo properties. This study paves the way towards a physical understanding of scaling relations, particularly to how systematics in their scatter are connected to the mass assembly histories of haloes.},

Our motivation is that well-defined samples of galaxy groups/clusters, which can be used to represent the dark halo population, can now be selected from large redshift surveys of galaxies, and our ultimate goal is to use such data to reconstruct the cosmic density field in the local Universe. Our reconstruction method starts with a sample of dark matter haloes above a given mass threshold. Each volume element in space is assigned to the domain of the nearest halo according to a distance measure that is scaled by the virial radius of the halo. The distribution of the mass in and around dark matter haloes of a given mass is modelled using the cross-correlation function between dark matter haloes and the mass distribution within their domains. We use N-body cosmological simulations to show that the density profiles required in our reconstruction scheme can be determined reliably from large cosmological simulations, and that our method can reconstruct the density field accurately using haloes with masses down to {\textasciitilde}1012h-1Msolar (above which samples of galaxy groups can be constructed from current large redshift surveys of galaxies). Working in redshift space, we demonstrate that the redshift distortions due to the peculiar velocities of haloes can be corrected in an iterative way. We also describe some applications of our method.},

  abstract = {Context. The rotation curve, the total mass and the gravitational potential of the Galaxy are sensitive measurements of the dark matter halo profile. Aims: Cuspy and cored DM halo profiles are analysed with respect to recent astronomical constraints in order to constrain the shape of the Galactic DM halo and the local DM density. Methods: All Galactic density components (luminous matter and DM) are parametrized. Then the total density distribution is constrained by astronomical observations: 1) the total mass of the Galaxy, 2) the total matter density at the position of the Sun, 3) the surface density of the visible matter, 4) the surface density of the total matter in the vicinity of the Sun, 5) the rotation speed of the Sun and 6) the shape of the velocity distribution within and above the Galactic disc. The mass model of the Galaxy is mainly constrained by the local matter density (Oort limit), the rotation speed of the Sun and the total mass of the Galaxy from tracer stars in the halo. Results: We showed from a statistical {$\chi$}{\textasciicircum}2 fit to all data that the local DM density is strongly positively (negatively) correlated with the scale length of the DM halo (baryonic disc). Since these scale lengths are poorly constrained the local DM density can vary from 0.2 to 0.4 GeV cm-3 (0.005-0.01{\textasciitilde}M\_{$\odot$} pc-3) for a spherical DM halo profile and allowing total Galaxy masses up to 2 {\texttimes} 1012{\textasciitilde}M\_{$\odot$}. For oblate DM haloes and dark matter discs, as predicted in recent N-body simulations, the local DM density can be increased significantly.},

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(M,c{\textbar}z)=b(M{\textbar}z)bcvir(c{\textbar}M/M*). Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high-concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M{$<$}{\textasciitilde}M*, while low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M{$>$}{\textasciitilde}M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

This version contains a finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured, dynamic Voronoi tessellation coupled to a tree-particle-mesh algorithm for the Poisson equation either on a Newtonian or cosmologically expanding spacetime. Time integration is performed adopting local time step constraints for each cell individually, solving the fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. AREPO is a massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the message passing interface (MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical workload and memory balancing scheme to allow for optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The employed parallelization algorithms of AREPO are deterministic and produce binary-identical results when rerun on the same machine and with the same number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of galaxy formation. AREPO also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new scientific users.},

  abstract = {The inefficiency of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies is widely believed to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with the surrounding gas. Achieving a sufficiently rapid reddening of moderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however proven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting us to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of supermassive black holes. For high-accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the surrounding gas thermally, similar to the 'quasar mode' in previous work. For low-accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model that imparts momentum to the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of feedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of different types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for the importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies. We find that a large fraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalizes via shocks in the surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In cosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non-star-forming massive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole growth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.},

  abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ``dark energy'' with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ``Stage IV'' dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

  abstract = {We measure the velocity dispersions of clusters of galaxies selected by the redMaPPer algorithm in the first three years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), allowing us to probe cluster selection and richness estimation, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, in light of cluster dynamics. Our sample consists of 126 clusters with sufficient spectroscopy for individual velocity dispersion estimates. We examine the correlations between cluster velocity dispersion, richness, X-ray temperature and luminosity as well as central galaxy velocity offsets. The velocity dispersion-richness relation exhibits a bimodal distribution. The majority of clusters follow scaling relations between velocity dispersion, richness, and X-ray properties similar to those found for previous samples; however, there is a significant population of clusters with velocity dispersions which are high for their richness. These clusters account for roughly 20{\textbackslash}\% of the \${\textbackslash}lambda {$<$} 70\$ systems in our sample, but more than half of \${\textbackslash}lambda {$<$} 70\$ clusters at \$z{$>$}0.5\$. A couple of these systems are hot and X-ray bright as expected for massive clusters with richnesses that appear to have been underestimated, but most appear to have high velocity dispersions for their X-ray properties likely due to line-of-sight structure. These results suggest that projection effects contribute significantly to redMaPPer selection, particularly at higher redshifts and lower richnesses. The redMaPPer determined richnesses for the velocity dispersion outliers are consistent with their X-ray properties, but several are X-ray undetected and deeper data is needed to understand their nature.},

  abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion). We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators. We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

  abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

We use the Zel'dovich approximation to compute the two-point function of the matter and biased tracers, and compare to the results of N-body simulations and other Lagrangian perturbation theories. We show that Lagrangian perturbation theories converge well and that the Zel'dovich approximation provides a good fit to the N-body results except for the quadrupole moment of the halo correlation function. We extend the calculation of halo bias to third order and also consider non-local biasing schemes, none of which remove the discrepancy. We argue that a part of the discrepancy owes to an incorrect prediction of inter-halo velocity correlations. We use the Zel'dovich approximation to compute the ingredients of the Gaussian streaming model and show that this hybrid method provides a good fit to clustering of haloes in redshift space down to scales of tens of Mpc.},

Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation {$\xi$}gg(r) and galaxy-matter cross-correlation {$\xi$}gm(r) as a function of {$\sigma$}8, {\textohm}m, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large-scale environment to represent possible effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density {$\sim$}0.3 arcmin-2). Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over 0.5 {$\leq$} r\_ p {$\leq$} 30 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc yields a 2 per cent constraint on the parameter combination {$\sigma$} \_8{\textohm} \_ m{\textasciicircum}\{0.6\}, a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales (r\_ p {$>$} 2 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc, 4 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc for {$\gamma$}t, wp). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters. Increasing the effective source density to 3 arcmin-2 sharpens the constraint on {$\sigma$} \_8{\textohm} \_ m{\textasciicircum}\{0.6\} by a further factor of two. With robust modelling into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-per cent level with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the Dark Energy Survey.},

Using one of the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail the correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size, stellar mass, and surface density) from z = 2 to the present. At all redshifts, massive quiescent galaxies (i.e., those with little or no star formation) occupy the extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight mass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both densities and sizes. Conversely, galaxies with the highest surface densities comprise a nearly homogeneous population with little or no ongoing star formation, while less dense galaxies exhibit high star formation rates and varying levels of dust obscuration. Both the sizes and surface densities of quiescent galaxies evolve strongly from z = 2-0; we parameterize this evolution for both populations with simple power-law functions and present best-fit parameters for comparison to future theoretical models. Higher-mass quiescent galaxies undergo faster structural evolution, consistent with previous results. Interestingly, star-forming galaxies' sizes and densities evolve at rates similar to those of quiescent galaxies. It is therefore possible that the same physical processes drive the structural evolution of both populations, suggesting that "dry mergers" may not be the sole culprit in this size evolution.},

Both samples are selected from the same approximately 9 sq deg sky area and we examine them using common XMM-Newton, Spitizer Wide-Area Infrared Extra-galactic (SWIRE) survey, and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey data. Clusters from each sample are compared employing aperture measures of X-ray and MIR emission. We divide the SpARCS distant cluster sample into three sub-samples: (i) X-ray bright, (ii) X-ray faint, MIR bright, and (iii) X-ray faint, MIR faint clusters. We determine that X-ray- and MIR-selected clusters display very similar surface brightness distributions of galaxy MIR light. In addition, the average location and amplitude of the galaxy red sequence as measured from stacked colour histograms is very similar in the X-ray- and MIR-selected samples. The sub-sample of X-ray faint, MIR bright clusters displays a distribution of brightest cluster galaxy-barycentre position offsets which extends to higher values than all other samples. This observation indicates that such clusters may exist in a more disturbed state compared to the majority of the distant cluster population sampled by XMM-LSS and SpARCS. This conclusion is supported by stacked X-ray images for the X-ray faint, MIR bright cluster sub-sample that display weak, centrally concentrated X-ray emission, consistent with a population of growing clusters accreting from an extended envelope of material.},

We have confirmed this cluster with spectroscopic redshifts of 15 members at z=0.276, with a velocity dispersion of 615 km s-1. We use the tangential shear as a function of source photometric redshift to estimate the lens redshift independently and find zl=0.30+/-0.08. The good agreement with the spectroscopy indicates that the redshift evolution of the mass function may be measurable from the imaging data alone in shear-selected surveys.},

However, the hardest ones to find seem to be the rarest and brightest specimens. Here we study the properties of the most luminous of all quasars found so far. These have been overlooked until recently, which demonstrates that modern all-sky surveys have much to reveal. The black hole in this quasar accretes around one solar mass per day onto an existing mass of {$\sim$}17 billion solar masses. In this process, the accretion disk alone releases a radiative energy of 2 {\texttimes} 1041 W. If the quasar is not strongly gravitationally lensed, then its broad-line region is expected to have the largest physical and angular diameter occurring in the Universe and this will allow the Very Large Telescope Interferometer to image its rotation and measure its black-hole mass directly. This will be an important test for broad-line region size-luminosity relationships, whose extrapolation has underpinned common black-hole mass estimates at high redshift.},

We advocate an approach, analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing, in which the observables in each redshift bin are the mean number counts and the mean weak lensing profile of clusters above a mass proxy threshold. The primary astrophysical nuisance parameter is the logarithmic scatter between the mass proxy and true mass near the threshold. For surveys similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Survey (HLS), and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast aggregate precision on sigma\_8 of 0.26\%, 0.24\%, and 0.10\%, respectively, if the mass-observable scatter has an external prior better than 0.01. These constraints would be degraded by about 20\% for a 0.05 prior on scatter in the case of DES or HLS and for a 0.016 prior for LSST. A one-month observing program with Roman Space Telescope targeting approximately 2500 massive clusters could achieve a 0.5\% constraint on sigma\_8(z=0.7) on its own, or a {\textasciitilde}0.33\% constraint in combination with the HLS. Realizing the constraining power of clusters requires accurate knowledge of the mass-observable relation and stringent control of systematics. We provide analytic approximations to our numerical results that allow easy scaling to other survey assumptions or other methods of cluster mass estimation.},

In these experiments, accurate modelling of covariance matrices of cluster weak lensing plays the key role in obtaining robust measurements of the mean mass of clusters and cosmological parameters. We use a combination of analytical calculations and high-resolution N-body simulations to derive accurate covariance matrices that span from the virial regime to linear scales of the cluster-matter cross-correlation. We validate this calculation using a public ray-tracing lensing simulation and provide a software package for calculating covariance matrices for a wide range of cluster and source sample choices. We discuss the relative importance of shape noise and density fluctuations, the impact of radial bin size, and the impact of off-diagonal elements. For a weak lensing source density 10 per square arcmin, shape noise typically dominates the variance on comoving scales less than 5 Mpc/h. However, for 60 per square arcmin, potentially achievable with future weak lensing experiments, density fluctuations typically dominate the variance at scales greater than 1 Mpc/h and remain comparable to shape noise on smaller scales.},

  abstract = {Self-calibration techniques for analyzing galaxy cluster counts utilize the abundance and the clustering amplitude of dark matter halos. These properties simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the cluster observable-mass relation. It was recently discovered that the clustering amplitude of halos depends not only on the halo mass, but also on various secondary variables, such as the halo formation time and the concentration; these dependences are collectively termed "assembly bias." Applying modified Fisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these secondary variables have a significant impact on the study of dark energy properties using the self-calibration technique in current (SDSS) and the near future (DES, SPT, and LSST) cluster surveys. The impact of the secondary dependence is determined by (1) the scatter in the observable-mass relation and (2) the correlation between observable and secondary variables. We find that for optical surveys, the secondary dependence does not significantly influence an SDSS-like survey; however, it may affect a DES-like survey (given the high scatter currently expected from optical clusters) and an LSST-like survey (even for low scatter values and low correlations). For an SZ survey such as SPT, the impact of secondary dependence is insignificant if the scatter is 20\% or lower but can be enhanced by the potential high scatter values introduced by a highly correlated background. Accurate modeling of the assembly bias is necessary for cluster self-calibration in the era of precision cosmology.},

  abstract = {Cosmological constraints from current and upcoming galaxy cluster surveys are limited by the accuracy of cluster mass calibration. In particular, optically identified galaxy clusters are prone to selection effects that can bias the weak lensing mass calibration. We investigate the selection bias of the stacked cluster lensing signal associated with optically selected clusters, using clusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm in the Buzzard simulations as a case study. We find that at a given cluster halo mass, the residuals of redMaPPer richness and weak lensing signal are positively correlated. As a result, for a given richness selection, the stacked lensing signal is biased high compared with what we would expect from the underlying halo mass probability distribution. The cluster lensing selection bias can thus lead to overestimated mean cluster mass and biased cosmology results. We show that the lensing selection bias exhibits a strong scale dependence and is approximately 20--60~per~cent for {$\Delta\Sigma$} at large scales. This selection bias largely originates from spurious member galaxies within {\textpm}20--60~\$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm Mpc\$ along the line of sight, highlighting the importance of quantifying projection effects associated with the broad redshift distribution of member galaxies in photometric cluster surveys. While our results qualitatively agree with those in the literature, accurate quantitative modelling of the selection bias is needed to achieve the goals of cluster lensing cosmology and will require synthetic catalogues covering a wide range of galaxy--halo connection models.},

Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun and have specific star formation rates above 1/t\_H. We model the 7-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible on the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to {\textasciitilde}20\% to the integrated SFR, but only 7\% or less to the integrated mass of all massive star-forming galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 1 and z {\textasciitilde} 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100 - 200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

  abstract = {We propose that observations of super-massive galaxies contain cosmological constraining power similar to conventional cluster cosmology, and we provide promising indications that the associated systematic errors are comparably easier to control. We consider a fiducial spectroscopic and stellar mass complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) and forecast how constraints on Omega\_m-sigma\_8 from this sample will compare with those from number counts of clusters based on richness. At fixed number density, we find that massive galaxies offer similar constraints to galaxy clusters. However, a mass-complete galaxy sample from DESI has the potential to probe lower halo masses than standard optical cluster samples (which are typically limited to richness above 20 and halo mass above 10{\textasciicircum}13.5); additionally, it is straightforward to cleanly measure projected galaxy clustering for such a DESI sample, which we show can substantially improve the constraining power on Omega\_m. We also compare the constraining power of stellar mass-limited samples to those from larger but mass-incomplete samples (e.g., the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, BGS, Sample); relative to a lower number density stellar mass-limited samples, we find that a BGS-like sample improves statistical constraints by 60\% for Omega\_m and 40\% for sigma\_8, but this uses small scale information which will be harder to model for BGS. Our initial assessment of the systematics associated with supermassive galaxy cosmology yields promising results. The proposed samples have a 10\% satellite fraction, but we show that cosmological constraints may be robust to the impact of satellites. These findings motivate future work to realize the potential of super-massive galaxies to probe lower halo masses than richness-based clusters and to avoid persistent systematics associated with optical cluster finding.},

For massive central galaxies (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.2\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 to 100 kpc (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star,[50,100]\}\$) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star,[50,100]\}\$ correlates better with halo mass than the total amount of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes are different between Illustris and IllustrisTNG100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (about 70\% in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star,[50,100]\}\$). These results demonstrate the potential of using the outskirt stellar mass to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection in massive dark matter halos and trace dark matter halos better.},

The power afforded by strong gravitation lensing allows us to observe galaxies with higher angular resolution beyond current facilities. We select a stellar mass limited sample and divide them into star-forming or quiescent classes based on their rest-frame UVJ colours from the ASTRODEEP catalogues. Source reconstruction is carried out with the recently released lenstruction software, which is built on the multipurpose gravitational lensing software lenstronomy. We derive the empirical relation between size and mass for the late-type galaxies with \$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}gt 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at 1 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.5 and \$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}gt 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ at 2.5 \&lt; z \&lt; 3, and at a fixed stellar mass, we find galaxy sizes evolve as \$R {\textbackslash}rm \_\{eff\} {\textbackslash}propto (1+z){\textasciicircum}\{-1.05{\textbackslash}pm 0.37\}\$. The intrinsic scatter is \&lt;0.1\,dex at z \&lt; 1.5 but increases to {$\sim$}0.3\,dex at higher redshift. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in blank fields. We evaluate the uncertainties associated with the choice of lens model by comparing size measurements using five different and publicly available models, finding the choice of lens model leads to a 3.7~per~cent uncertainty of the median value, and {$\sim$}25 ~per~cent scatter for individual galaxies. Our work demonstrates the use of strong lensing magnification to boost resolution does not introduce significant uncertainties in this kind of work, and paves the way for wholesale applications of the sophisticated lens reconstruction technique to higher redshifts and larger samples.},

  abstract = {The newly launched X-ray satellite, eROSITA, has recently revealed two gigantic bubbles extending to {\textasciitilde}80{$^\circ$} above and below the Galactic Centre. The morphology of these `eROSITA bubbles' bears a remarkable resemblance to the Fermi bubbles previously discovered by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and its counterpart, the microwave haze. The physical origin of these striking structures has been intensely debated; however, because of their symmetry about the Galactic Centre, they probably originate from some energetic outbursts from the Galactic Centre in the past. Here we propose a theoretical model in which the eROSITA bubbles, Fermi bubbles and the microwave haze could be simultaneously explained by a single event of jet activity from the central supermassive black hole a few million years ago. Using numerical simulations, we show that this model could successfully reproduce the morphology and multi-wavelength spectra of the observed bubbles and haze, which allows us to derive critical constraints on the energetics and timescales of the outburst. This study serves as an important step forward in our understanding of the past Galactic Centre activity of our own Galaxy and may bring valuable insights into the broader picture of supermassive-black-hole--galaxy co-evolution in the context of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters enable unique opportunities to study cosmology, dark matter, galaxy evolution, and strongly-lensed transients. We here present a new cluster-finding algorithm, CluMPR (Clusters from Masses and Photometric Redshifts), that exploits photometric redshifts (photo-z's) as well as photometric stellar mass measurements. CluMPR uses a 2-dimensional binary search tree to search for overdensities of massive galaxies with similar redshifts on the sky and then probabilistically assigns cluster membership by accounting for photo-z uncertainties. We leverage the deep DESI Legacy Surveys grzW1W2 imaging over one-third of the sky to create a catalogue of {\textasciitilde} 300,000 galaxy cluster candidates out to z = 1, including tabulations of member galaxies and estimates of each cluster's total stellar mass. Compared to other methods, CluMPR is particularly effective at identifying clusters at the high end of the redshift range considered (z = 0.75-1), with minimal contamination from low-mass groups. These characteristics make it ideal for identifying strongly lensed high-redshift supernovae and quasars that are powerful probes of cosmology, dark matter, and stellar astrophysics. As an example application of this cluster catalogue, we present a catalogue of candidate wide-angle strongly-lensed quasars in Appendix C. The five best candidates identified from this sample include two known lensed quasar systems and a possible changing-look lensed QSO with SDSS spectroscopy. All code and catalogues produced in this work are publicly available (see Data Availability).},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear can only be measured where there are galaxies. This source-lens clustering (SLC) effect has two sources, intrinsic source clustering and cosmic magnification (magnification/size bias). Lensing tomography can suppress the former. However, this reduction is limited by the existence of photo-z error and nonzero redshift bin width. Furthermore, SLC induced by cosmic magnification cannot be reduced by lensing tomography. Through N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of SLC on the lensing power spectrum in the context of lensing tomography. We consider both the standard estimator and the pixel-based estimator. We find that none of them can satisfactorily handle both sources of SLC. (1) For the standard estimator, SLC induced by both sources can bias the lensing power spectrum by O{$\leq$}ft( 1 {\textbackslash}right)-O(10)\%. Intrinsic source clustering also increases statistical uncertainties in the measured lensing power spectrum. However, the standard estimator suppresses intrinsic source clustering in the cross-spectrum. (2) In contrast, the pixel-based estimator suppresses SLC through cosmic magnification. However, it fails to suppress SLC through intrinsic source clustering and the measured lensing power spectrum can be biased low by O{$\leq$}ft( 1 {\textbackslash}right)-O(10)\%. In short, for typical photo-z errors (\{{$\sigma$} \}z\vphantom\{\}/{$\leq$}ft( 1+z {\textbackslash}right)=0.05) and photo-z bin sizes (\{{$\Delta$}\{\{z\}P\}=0.2), SLC alters the lensing E-mode power spectrum by 1-10\%, with {\textbackslash}ell {$\sim$} \{\{10\}3\} and \{\{z\}s\}{$\sim$} 1 being of particular interest to weak lensing cosmology. Therefore the SLC is a severe systematic for cosmology in Stage-IV lensing surveys. We present useful scaling relations to self-calibrate the SLC effect.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {The clustering signals of galaxy clusters are powerful tools for self-calibrating the mass-observable relation and are complementary to cluster abundance and lensing. In this work, we explore the possibility of combining three correlation functions - cluster lensing, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation function, and the galaxy autocorrelation function - to self-calibrate optical cluster selection bias, the boosted clustering and lensing signals in a richness-selected sample mainly caused by projection effects. We develop mock catalogues of redMaGiC-like galaxies and redMaPPer-like clusters by applying halo occupation distribution models to N-body simulations and using counts-in-cylinders around massive haloes as a richness proxy. In addition to the previously known small-scale boost in projected correlation functions, we find that the projection effects also significantly boost three-dimensional correlation functions to scales of 100 \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm Mpc\$. We perform a likelihood analysis assuming survey conditions similar to the Dark Energy Survey and show that the selection bias can be self-consistently constrained at the 10 per cent level. We discuss strategies for applying this approach to real data. We expect that expanding the analysis to smaller scales and using deeper lensing data would further improve the constraints on cluster selection bias.},

We design methods to mask detected galaxies and stars in the images and stack the cluster light profiles, while accounting for several systematic effects (sky subtraction, instrumental point-spread function, cluster selection effects and residual light in the ICL raw detection from background and cluster galaxies). The methods allow us to acquire high signal-to-noise measurements of the ICL and central galaxies (CGs), which we separate with radial cuts. The ICL appears as faint and diffuse light extending to at least 1 Mpc from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness level of 30 mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. The ICL and the cluster CG contribute to \$44{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm17\${\textbackslash}\% of the total cluster stellar luminosity within 1 Mpc. The ICL color is overall consistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays the trend of becoming bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates an interesting self-similarity feature -- for clusters in different richness ranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after scaling with cluster \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200m\}\$, and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of the cluster radial mass distribution. These analyses are based on the DES redMaPPer cluster sample identified in the first year of observations.},

We apply a 'stacking' method to over 4000 galaxy clusters identified by the redMaPPer cluster finder in the redshift range of 0.2-0.5. This yields high-signal-to-noise circularly averaged profile measurements of the central galaxy and intra-cluster light out to 1 Mpc from the cluster centre. Using redMaPPer richness as a cluster mass indicator, we find that the brightness of the intra-cluster light has a strong mass dependence throughout the 0.2-0.5 redshift range, and this dependence grows stronger at a larger radius. In terms of redshift evolution, we find some evidence that the central galaxy, as well as the diffuse light within the transition region between the cluster central galaxy and intra-cluster light within 80 kpc from the centre, may be growing over time. At larger radii, more than 80 kpc away from the cluster centre, we do not detect evidence of additional redshift evolution beyond the cluster mass dependence, consistent with the findings from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation. We speculate that the major driver of intra-cluster light growth, especially at large radii, is associated with cluster mass growth. Finally, we find that the colour of the cluster central galaxy and intra-cluster light displays a radial gradient that becomes bluer at a larger radius, which is consistent with a stellar stripping and disruption origin of intra-cluster light as suggested by simulation studies.},

  abstract = {We introduce deep-field metacalibration, a new technique that reduces the pixel noise in metacalibration estimators of weak lensing shear signals by using a deeper imaging survey for calibration. In standard metacalibration, when estimating the object's shear response, extra noise is added to correct the effect of shearing the noise in the image, increasing the uncertainty on shear estimates by {\textasciitilde} 20\%. Our new deep-field metacalibration technique leverages a separate, deeper imaging survey to calculate calibrations with less degradation in image noise. We demonstrate that weak lensing shear measurement with deep-field metacalibration is unbiased up to second-order shear effects. We provide algorithms to apply this technique to imaging surveys and describe how to generalize it to shear estimators that rely explicitly on object detection (e.g., metacalibration).

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the improvement in weak lensing precision will depend on the somewhat unknown details of the LSST Deep Drilling Field (DDF) observations in terms of area and depth, the relative point-spread function properties of the DDF and main LSST surveys, and the relative contribution of pixel noise vs. intrinsic shape noise to the total shape noise in the survey. We conservatively estimate that the degradation in precision is reduced from 20\% for metacalibration to {\textasciitilde} 5\% or less for deep-field metacalibration, which we attribute primarily to the increased source density and reduced pixel noise contributions to the overall shape noise. Finally, we show that the technique is robust to sample variance in the LSST DDFs due to their large area, with the equivalent calibration error being {\textasciitilde} 0.1\%. The deep-field metacalibration technique provides higher signal-to-noise weak lensing measurements while still meeting the stringent systematic error requirements of future surveys.},

To do so, we make use of large observational datasets from KiDS+VIKING+HSC-SSP and extend the analysis out to redshift z = 2.5 using the HST surveys CANDELS and 3D-DASH. We construct suites of SKIRT radiative transfer models for idealized galaxies observed under random viewing angles with the aim of reproducing the aforementioned distributions, including the level and inclination dependence of dust attenuation. We find that attenuation-based dust mass estimates are at odds with constraints from far-infrared observations, especially at higher redshifts, when assuming smooth star and dust geometries of equal extent. We demonstrate that UV-to-near-IR and far-infrared constraints can be reconciled by invoking clumpier dust geometries for galaxies at higher redshifts and/or very compact dust cores. We discuss implications for the significant wavelength- and redshift-dependent differences between half-light and half-mass radii that result from spatially varying dust columns within -- especially massive -- star-forming galaxies.},

In this letter, we use the Illustris-TNG simulation to demonstrate that selecting on galaxy counts induces a selection effect because of projection and correlation between different observables. We compute the weak-lensing-like projected mass estimations of dark matter haloes and examine their projected subhalo counts. In the two-dimensional (2D) projected space, haloes that are measured as more massive than truth have higher subhalo counts. Thus, projection along the line of sight creates cluster observables that are correlated with cluster mass measurement deviations, which in turn creates a mass measurement bias when the clusters are selected by this correlated observable. We demonstrate that the bias is predicted in a forward model using the observable-mass measurement correlation.},

  abstract = {Aims. Understanding how the properties of galaxies relate to the properties of the hot circum-galactic medium (CGM) around them can constrain galaxy evolution models. We aim to measure the scaling relations between the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM and the fundamental properties (stellar mass and halo mass) of a galaxy. Methods. We measured the X-ray luminosity of the hot CGM based on the surface brightness profiles of central galaxy samples measured from Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA all-sky survey data. We related the X-ray luminosity to the galaxies' stellar and halo mass, and we compared the observed relations to the self-similar model and intrinsic (i.e., not forward-modeled) output of the IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA simulations. Results. The average hot CGM X-ray luminosity (LX, CGM) correlates with the galaxy's stellar mass (M*). It increases from (1.6 {\textpm} 2.1) {\texttimes} 1039 erg s-1 to (3.4 {\textpm} 0.3) {\texttimes} 1041 erg s-1, when log(M*) increases from 10.0 to 11.5. A power law describes the correlation as log(LX, CGM) = (2.4 {\textpm} 0.1){\texttimes}log(M*)+(14.6 {\textpm} 1.5). The hot CGM X-ray luminosity as a function of halo mass is measured within log(M500c) = 11.3 - 13.7, extending our knowledge of the scaling relation by more than two orders of magnitude. LX, CGM increases with M500c from (3.0 {\textpm} 1.6) {\texttimes} 1039 erg s-1 at log(M500c) = 11.3 to (1.3 {\textpm} 0.1) {\texttimes} 1042 erg s-1 at log(M500c) = 13.7. The relation follows a power law of log(LX, CGM) = (1.32 {\textpm} 0.05){\texttimes}log(M500c)+(24.1 {\textpm} 0.7). Our observations highlight the necessity of non-gravitational processes at the galaxy group scale while suggesting these processes are sub-dominant at the galaxy scale. We show that the outputs of current cosmological galaxy simulations generally align with the observational results uncovered here but with possibly important deviations in selected mass ranges. Conclusions. We explore, at the low mass end, the average scaling relations between the CGM X-ray luminosity and the galaxy's stellar mass or halo mass, which constitutes a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and feedback processes.},

  abstract = {Context. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides the material needed for galaxy formation and influences galaxy evolution. The hot (T {$>$} 106K) CGM is poorly detected around galaxies with stellar masses (M*) lower than 3 {\texttimes} 1011 M{$\odot$} due to the low surface brightness. Aims. We aim to detect the X-ray emission from the hot CGM around Milky Way-mass (MW-mass, log(M*/M{$\odot$}) = 10.5 - 11.0) and M31-mass (log(M*/M{$\odot$}) = 11.0 - 11.25) galaxies, in addition to measuring the X-ray surface brightness profile of the hot CGM. Methods. We applied a stacking technique to gain enough statistics to detect the hot CGM. We used the X-ray data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASS:4). We discussed how the satellite galaxies could bias the stacking and the method we used to carefully build the central galaxy samples. Based on the SDSS spectroscopic survey and halo-based group finder algorithm, we selected central galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts of zspec {$<$} 0.2 and stellar masses of 10.0 {$<$} log(M*/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 11.5 (85 222 galaxies) -- or halo masses of 11.5 {$<$} log(M200m/M{$\odot$}) {$<$} 14.0 (125,512 galaxies). By stacking the X-ray emission around galaxies, we obtained the mean X-ray surface brightness profiles. We masked the detected X-ray point sources and carefully modeled the X-ray emission from the unresolved active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB) to obtain the X-ray emission from the hot CGM. Results. We measured the X-ray surface brightness profiles for central galaxies of log(M*/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 10.0 or log(M200m/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 11.5. We detected the X-ray emission around MW-mass and more massive central galaxies extending up to the virial radius (Rvir). The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the extended emission around MW-mass (M31-mass) galaxy is about 3.1{$\sigma$} (4.7{$\sigma$}) within Rvir. We used a {$\beta$} model to describe the X-ray surface brightness profile of the hot CGM (SX, CGM). We obtained a central surface brightness of log(SX,0[erg s-1 kpc-2]) = 36.7-0.4+1.4 (37.1-0.4+1.5) and {$\beta$} = 0.43-0.06+0.10 (0.37-0.02+0.04) for MW-mass (M31-mass) galaxies. For galaxies with log(M200m/M{$\odot$}) {$>$} 12.5, the extended X-ray emission is detected with S/N {$>$} 2.8{$\sigma$} and the SX, CGM can be described by a {$\beta$} model with {$\beta$} {$\approx$} 0.4 and log(SX,0[erg s-1 kpc-2]) {$>$} 37.2. We estimated the baryon budget of the hot CGM and obtained a value that is lower than the prediction of {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology, indicating significant gas depletion in these halos. We extrapolated the hot CGM profile measured within Rvir to larger radii and found that within {$\approx$}3Rvir, the baryon budget is close to the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology prediction. Conclusions. We measured the extended X-ray emission from representative populations of central galaxies around and above MW-mass out to Rvir. Our results set a firm footing for the presence of the hot CGM around such galaxies. These measurements constitute a new benchmark for galaxy evolution models and possible implementations of feedback processes therein.},

The measurement should be carried out in Fourier space, in which the point spread function (PSF) can be transformed to a desired form with multiplications, and the spatial derivatives can be easily measured. This method is mathematically well defined regardless of the galaxy morphology and the form of the PSF, and involves simple procedures of image processing. Furthermore, with high-resolution galaxy images, this approach allows one to probe the shape distortions of galaxy substructures, which can potentially provide much more independent shear measurements than the ellipticities of the whole galaxy. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method using computer-generated mock galaxy images.},

  abstract = {Neglecting the second order corrections in weak lensing measurements can lead to a few percent uncertainties on cosmic shears, and becomes more important for cluster lensing mass reconstructions. Existing methods which claim to measure the reduced shears are not necessarily accurate to the second order when a point spread function (PSF) is present. We show that the method of Zhang (2008) exactly measures the reduced shears at the second order level in the presence of PSF. A simple theorem is provided for further confirming our calculation, and for judging the accuracy of any shear measurement method at the second order based on its properties at the first order. The method of Zhang (2008) is well defined mathematically. It does not require assumptions on the morphologies of galaxies and the PSF. To reach a sub-percent level accuracy, the CCD pixel size is required to be not larger than 1/3 of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF, regardless of whether the PSF has a power-law or exponential profile at large distances. Using a large ensemble (gtrsim107) of mock galaxies of unrestricted morphologies, we study the shear recovery accuracy under different noise conditions. We find that contaminations to the shear signals from the noise of background photons can be removed in a well defined way because they are not correlated with the source shapes. The residual shear measurement errors due to background noise are consistent with zero at the sub-percent level even when the amplitude of such noise reaches about 1/10 of the source flux within the half-light radius of the source. This limit can in principle be extended further with a larger galaxy ensemble in our simulations. On the other hand, the source Poisson noise remains to be a cause of systematic errors. For a sub-percent level accuracy, our method requires the amplitude of the source Poisson noise to be less than 1/80 {\textasciitilde} 1/100 of the source flux within the half-light radius of the source, corresponding to collecting roughly 104 source photons.},

  abstract = {Counts of galaxy clusters offer a high-precision probe of cosmology, but control of systematic errors will determine the accuracy of this measurement. Using Buzzard simulations, we quantify one such systematic, the triaxiality distribution of clusters identified with the redMaPPer optical cluster finding algorithm, which was used in the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 (DES Y1) cluster cosmology analysis. We test whether redMaPPer selection biases the clusters' shape and orientation and find that it only biases orientation, preferentially selecting clusters with their major axes oriented along the line of sight. Modelling the richness-mass relation as log-linear, we find that the log-richness amplitude ln (A) is boosted from the lowest to highest orientation bin with a significance of 14{$\sigma$}, while the orientation dependence of the richness-mass slope and intrinsic scatter is minimal. We also find that the weak lensing shear-profile ratios of cluster-associated dark haloes in different orientation bins resemble a 'bottleneck' shape that can be quantified with a Cauchy function. We test the correlation of orientation with two other leading systematics in cluster cosmology - miscentering and projection - and find a null correlation. The resulting mass bias predicted from our templates confirms the DES Y1 finding that triaxiality is a leading source of bias in cluster cosmology. However, the richness-dependence of the bias confirms that triaxiality does not fully resolve the tension at low-richness between DES Y1 cluster cosmology and other probes. Our model can be used for quantifying the impact of triaxiality bias on cosmological constraints for upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters.},

The Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA All Sky Survey (SRG/eRASS) provides a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical galaxy samples. We obtained a 9{$\sigma$} significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3--1.2 keV band. Here, we introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries associated with filament galaxies. We found an approximately 40\% contamination fraction for these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60\% of the signal could be coming from the WHIM and a 5.4{$\sigma$} detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature log(T/K) = 6.84 {\textpm} 0.07, obtained by using a single temperature model, is marginally higher than in the simulation results. This could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. Assuming a 0.2 solar abundance, the best-fit baryon density contrast log{$\Delta$}b = 1.88 {\textpm} 0.18 is in general agreement with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation. This result suggests that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high end of the temperature and density values that characterize the entire WHIM population.},

We point out that FD provides a unique way of quantifying the accuracy of cosmic shear measurement. The idea is to stack the shear estimators from galaxies that share similar FD-induced shape distortions. Given that the latter can be calculated with parameters from astrometric calibrations, the accuracy of the shear estimator can be directly tested on real images. It provides a way to calibrate the multiplicative and additive shear recovery biases within the scientific data itself, without requiring simulations or any external data sets. We use the CFHTLenS images to test the Fourier\_Quad shear recovery method. We highlight some details in our image-processing pipeline, including background removal, source identification and deblending, astrometric calibration, star selection for point-spread function reconstruction, noise reduction, etc. We show that in the shear ranges of -0.005 {$\lessequivlnt$} g 1 {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.005 and -0.008 {$\lessequivlnt$} g 2 {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.008, the multiplicative biases are at the level of {$\lessequivlnt$}0.04. Slight additive biases on the order of {$\sim$}5 {\texttimes} 10-4 (6{$\sigma$}) are identified for sources provided by the official CFHTLenS catalog (not using its shear catalog), but are minor (4{$\sigma$}) for the source catalog generated by our Fourier\_Quad pipeline.},

In the context of weak lensing, we identify several new field-level analysis systematics (such as aliasing, Fourier mode-coupling, and density-induced shape noise), quantify their impact on cosmological constraints, and correct the biases to a percent level. Next, we find that model misspecification can lead to both absolute bias and incorrect uncertainty quantification for the inferred cosmological parameters in realistic simulations. The Gaussian map prior infers unbiased cosmological parameters, regardless of the true data distribution, but it yields overconfident uncertainties. The log-normal map prior quantifies the uncertainties accurately, although it requires careful calibration of the shift parameters for unbiased cosmological parameters. We demonstrate systematics control down to the 2\% level for both models, making them suitable for ongoing weak lensing surveys.},

The first sample is identical to the DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample, and the second sample is an extended LRG sample with 2-3 times the DESI LRG density. We present the improved photometric redshifts, tomographic binning and their spectroscopic redshift distributions and imaging systematics weights, and magnification bias coefficients. The catalogs and related data products will be made publicly available. The cosmological constraints using this sample and Planck lensing maps are presented in a companion paper. We also make public the new set of general-purpose photometric redshifts trained using DESI spectroscopic redshifts, which are used in this work, for all galaxies in LS DR9.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters identified with optical imaging tend to suffer from projection effects, which impact richness (the number of member galaxies in a cluster) and lensing coherently. Physically unassociated galaxies can be mistaken as cluster members due to the significant uncertainties in their line-of-sight distances, thereby changing the observed cluster richness; at the same time, projection effects alter the weak gravitational lensing signals of clusters, leading to a correlated scatter between richness and lensing at a given halo mass. As a result, the lensing signals for optically selected clusters tend to be biased high. This optical selection bias problem of cluster lensing is one of the key challenges in cluster cosmology. Fortunately, recently available multiwavelength observations of clusters provide a solution. We analyze a simulated data set mimicking the observed lensing of clusters identified by both optical photometry and gas properties, aiming to constrain this selection bias. Assuming a redMaPPer sample from the Dark Energy Survey with South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect observations, we find that an overlapping survey of 1300 square deg, 0.2 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.65, can constrain the average lensing bias to an accuracy of 5 percent. This provides an exciting opportunity for directly constraining optical selection bias from observations. We further show that our approach can remove the optical selection bias from the lensing signal, paving the way for future optical cluster cosmology analyses.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies trace the most non-linear peaks in the cosmic density field. The weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies by clusters can allow us to infer their masses. However, galaxies associated with the local environment of the cluster can also be intrinsically aligned due to the local tidal gradient, contaminating any cosmology derived from the lensing signal. We measure this intrinsic alignment in Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 REDMAPPER clusters. We find evidence of a non-zero mean radial alignment of galaxies within clusters between redshifts 0.1-0.7. We find a significant systematic in the measured ellipticities of cluster satellite galaxies that we attribute to the central galaxy flux and other intracluster light. We attempt to correct this signal, and fit a simple model for intrinsic alignment amplitude (AIA) to the measurement, finding AIA = 0.15 {\textpm} 0.04, when excluding data near the edge of the cluster. We find a significantly stronger alignment of the central galaxy with the cluster dark matter halo at low redshift and with higher richness and central galaxy absolute magnitude (proxies for cluster mass). This is an important demonstration of the ability of large photometric data sets like DES to provide direct constraints on the intrinsic alignment of galaxies within clusters. These measurements can inform improvements to small-scale modelling and simulation of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies to help improve the separation of the intrinsic alignment signal in weak lensing studies.},

  abstract = {We derive constraints on the matter density {\textohm}m and the amplitude of matter clustering {$\sigma$}8 from measurements of large-scale weak lensing (projected separation R = 5-30 h-1 Mpc) by clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey MaxBCG catalogue. The weak lensing signal is proportional to the product of {\textohm}m and the cluster-mass correlation function {$\xi$}cm. With the relation between optical richness and cluster mass constrained by the observed cluster number counts, the predicted lensing signal increases with increasing {\textohm}m or {$\sigma$}8, with mild additional dependence on the assumed scatter between richness and mass. The dependence of the signal on scale and richness partly breaks the degeneracies among these parameters. We incorporate external priors on the richness-mass scatter from comparisons to X-ray data and on the shape of the matter power spectrum from galaxy clustering, and we test our adopted model for {$\xi$}cm against N-body simulations. Using a Bayesian approach with minimal restrictive priors, we find {$\sigma$}8({\textohm}m/0.325)0.501 = 0.828 {\textpm} 0.049, with marginalized constraints of {\textohm} \_m=0.325\_\{-0.067\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.086\} and {$\sigma$} \_8=0.828\_\{-0.097\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.111\}, consistent with constraints from other MaxBCG studies that use weak lensing measurements on small scales (R {$\leq$} 2 h-1 Mpc). The ({\textohm}m, {$\sigma$}8) constraint is consistent with and orthogonal to the one inferred from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe cosmic microwave background data, reflecting agreement with the structure growth predicted by General Relativity for a {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model. A joint constraint assuming {$\Lambda$}CDM yields {\textohm} \_m=0.298\_\{-0.020\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.019\} and {$\sigma$} \_8=0.831\_\{-0.020\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.020\}. For these parameters and our best-fitting scatter, we obtain a tightly constrained mean richness-mass relation of MaxBCG clusters, N200 = 25.4(M/3.61 {\texttimes} 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$})0.74, with a normalization uncertainty of 1.5 per cent. Our cosmological parameter errors are dominated by the statistical uncertainties of the large-scale weak lensing measurements, which should shrink sharply with current and future imaging surveys.},

  abstract = {Recently, several studies have discovered a strong discrepancy between the large-scale clustering biases of two subsamples of galaxy clusters at the same halo mass, split by their average projected membership distances \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$. The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the maximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore whether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ due to projection effects from other systems along the line-of-sight. We thoroughly investigate the halo assembly bias of the photometrically-detected redMaPPer clusters in SDSS, by defining a new variant of the average membership distance estimator \${\textbackslash}tilde\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ that is more robust against projection effects in the cluster membership identification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we show that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ can be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by \${\textbackslash}tilde\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a ratio of \$1.02{\textbackslash}pm0.14\$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak lensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio between two \${\textbackslash}tilde\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mem\}\}\$-split subsamples should be \${$<$}1.10\$, which is at least 60\% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24) when split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the level of halo assembly bias exhibited by redMaPPer clusters in SDSS is consistent with the LCDM prediction. With a ten-fold increase in cluster numbers, deeper ongoing surveys will enable a more robust detection of halo assembly bias. Our findings also have important implications for how projection effects and their impact on cluster cosmology can be quantified in photometric cluster catalogs.},
